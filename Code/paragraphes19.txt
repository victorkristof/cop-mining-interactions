Canada then took the floor to withdraw Toronto"s candidacy to host the Permanent Secretariat. After the final speaker of the day, Estrada announced that Parties participating in the informal survey had selected Bonn as the location of the Permanent Secretariat. Switzerland expressed its regret and congratulated Germany. Germany stated it was aware of the responsibility accompanying the choice, and thanked Estrada and the delegates. The Executive-Secretary of the Interim Secretariat, Michael Zammit Cutajar, thanked Geneva for the hospitality extended since 1991. 
 Consultations on joint implementation met from Tuesday night until 6:30 am Wednesday morning. With the exception of credits, there appeared to be agreement on most of the text that establishes a JI pilot phase. On Wednesday, small groups of delegates met in the corridors, while trying to avoid video cameras, to forge a compromise. By 7:30 pm, when one developed country delegation said that they were unable to take a final decision until Thursday morning, it became apparent that agreement on JI would have to wait. Meanwhile, consultations on the adequacy of commitments continued. Some participants commented that there has been "progress" towards agreeing on a mandate to negotiate or consult on a protocol to be adopted by 1997. The question that remained when the group adjourned at 10:00 pm was just how vague this mandate would be.
