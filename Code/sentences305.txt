 \t\tRichard Kinley, Officer-in-Charge, UNFCCC Secretariat, said these \t\tconclusions on meeting arrangements were 93quite revolutionary 94 for this \t\tprocess.
He said the Secretariat would discontinue the current practice \t\tof scheduling evening meetings, and that the decision on what \t\tconstitutes exceptional circumstances would be left to elected officers.
\t\tHe noted the significant implications of restricting the negotiating \t\ttime available at meetings, given that there are about 36 substantive \t\titems or sub-items on the various agendas to be addressed in Nairobi.
\t\tDescribing the changes as 93shock therapy, 94 he expressed his 93deep \t\tanxiety 94 that such an approach could lead to process 93paralysis 94 unless \t\tparties prioritize issues.
