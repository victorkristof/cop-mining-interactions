 <p> JAPAN said that policies and measures should be cost effective, and that the measures should be implemented within a time frame that allows economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner

 Regarding implementation, he said that international negotiations on legal instruments should, <i>inter alia</i>, appropriately reflect the principles stipulated by Article 3, and not introduce any new commitments for non-Annex I Parties <p> The NETHERLANDS stated that a second national memorandum on climate change will be published in January 1996

 <p> GERMANY said policies and measures should be driven by quantified targets in an agreed time frame

 <p> SWITZERLAND said a task force or panel should work in parallel with the AGBM to narrow the list of policies and measures

 <p> IRAN said imposing the policies and measures of Annex I Parties on non-Annex I Parties will not only transfer resources from developing to developed countries, but will upset the terms of trade

 <p> CANADA supported a combined approach to policies and measures and the quantified emission reductions

 <p> NORWAY advocated common emission targets for groups of Parties, such as the OECD, which would be achieved through equitable and appropriate contributions by each of the Parties

 <p> VENEZUELA stated that the need for all policies and measures to be submitted should be assessed for economic, trade and social impacts, that full compliance will require innovative approaches, and that the AGBM should not hastily reject options or measures

 <p> POLAND said that in light of the broad scope of policies and measures that have already been applied, it is inappropriate to narrow the list of possibilities at this stage

 <p> INDIA noted that there have been hints of opening the present regime of the BM, and reminded delegates that the BM draws its substance from the doctrine of common but differentiated responsibilities

 <p> PERU said criteria should be developed to evaluate policies and measures

 <p> The PHILIPPINES, on behalf of the G-77 and China, said the US presentation distracts from the BM's focus on commitments by Annex I Parties

<p> The PHILIPPINES, on behalf of the G-77 and China, said the US presentation distracts from the BM's focus on commitments by Annex I Parties

 <p> MALAYSIA said the AGBM cannot lose sight of the fact that the majority of emissions is produced by developed countries and developing countries have relatively low per capita emissions

 <p> CHINA expressed dismay that Parties were suggesting more policies and measures at this stage

 <p> BRAZIL said that the establishment of numerical objectives is a prerequisite to the consideration of policies and measures

 <p> AUSTRALIA considers emission objectives and policies and measures to be interdependent, and said that a key benchmark will be the extent to which there will be a convergence of the two

 <p> CANADA supported the US proposal for a special session on quantitative reductions, and differentiated or regional targets among Annex I Parties

 <p> The NETHERLANDS said that the IPCC assessment highlights the need for global emissions to be lowered

 <p> The PHILIPPINES, on behalf of the G-77 and China, said that this item represented the G-77's contribution to the BM process

 <p> JAPAN said developed countries must take the lead on implementation, inventories and communications

 <p> PERU has completed its inventory with assistance from the US, but it will be difficult to continue commitments under Article 4

 <p> BRAZIL invited international coordination to complete its inventory, noting that the most uncertainty in IPCC projections is in deforestation and that it has more than one-third of the world's tropical forests

 <p> EGYPT said work to address climate change was currently underway and added that commitments from developed countries were an essential component to its continuation

 <p> SPAIN, on behalf of the EU, said the text of the BM must be the starting point for future work, and added that the process will not include any new commitments

 <p> ARGENTINA said the leadership of Annex I Parties is not an isolated fact, but will be supported by the non-Annex I Parties

 <p> AUSTRALIA said implementation of Article 4

 <p> BANGLADESH said despite studies demonstrating its vulnerability to climate change it will fulfill its obligations under Article 4

 <p> MALAYSIA said many developing countries do not have the capabilities and capacity in technical expertise or financial resources to complete inventories to international standards

 <p> CANADA said the BM does not diminish the commitments of non-Annex I Parties

 <p> CHINA said developing countries' implementation will depend on Annex I Parties' provision of resources and technology transfer, contrary to some comments that assistance depends on developing countries taking action

 <p> The PHILIPPINES, on behalf of the G-77 and China, stated that despite the lack of adequate resources and technology transfer assistance, non-Annex I countries such as Argentina and Bangladesh are still moving forward

 <p> INDIA supported the Malaysia proposal for a forum, and noted that early structuring of the TAPs will help the implementation process

 <p> VENEZUELA is making every effort to complete its national communication prior to the deadline, even though it is developing country experiencing a profound economic crisis

 <p> SPAIN, on behalf of the EU, presented a proposal on a possible protocol structure based on three principles: consistency with the BM, consistency with the Convention and the need for a dynamic instrument

 <p> AUSTRALIA stated that any protocol must address all GHGs, sources and sinks in a comprehensive manner, must address all elements in the BM in practical implementation measures, and must reflect the interlinking nature of the features and aims of the BM

 <p> ARGENTINA supported employing annexes for additional policies and measures

 <p> NORWAY supported Australia on comprehensiveness, saying the commitments should cover all GHGs, sinks and sources

 <p> CHINA said discussion should be on substantive issues, not the structure of a legal instrument, and that China is flexible on the form of instrument

 <p> ICELAND said the EU outline could be a point of departure

 JAPAN said clarifying scientific and technical issues, through a review of Annex I activities and quantitative assessment of their effects, would provide guidance to form a protocol

 BANGLADESH supported the AOSIS protocol with the German elements paper as the basis of the exchange of views

 EGYPT said the protocol should deal only with new commitments, while the reaffirmation of existing commitments remains a COP concern

<p> SPAIN, on behalf of the EU, presented a proposal on a possible protocol structure based on three principles: consistency with the BM, consistency with the Convention and the need for a dynamic instrument

<p> AUSTRALIA stated that any protocol must address all GHGs, sources and sinks in a comprehensive manner, must address all elements in the BM in practical implementation measures, and must reflect the interlinking nature of the features and aims of the BM

<p> ICELAND said the EU outline could be a point of departure

 CHINA reminded delegates of a decision taken in Berlin that "urges Annex II Parties to include measures taken regarding technology transfer" to each session of the COP

 PERU asked whether the second compilation will be ready by the tentative date

 The US stated that the document failed to mentioned an administrative official whose services were supplied by the US, and CANADA pledged to contribute C$65,000

 ITALY, on behalf of the EU, said assessment of technologies and methods for estimating the effects of measures have not been properly addressed

 <p> IRAN, on behalf of the Asian Group, said the Chair's proposal on the number of TAPs is acceptable, but no consensus on distribution of panel members exists

 NIGERIA said the African Group supported the Chair's paper

 The PHILIPPINES, coordinator of G-77/China on this issue, recalled that her group had entered these negotiations with a solid position, but had moved from it to accommodate the process

 SLOVENIA supported the Philippines on the TAPs and agreed with the US on the NGO intervention

 The PHILIPPINES said the G-77/China's understanding of balance seems to be at odds with the other groups

 <p> INDIA said that the SBSTA should take regional groups as the basis, and noted that Asia has both Annex I and non-Annex I countries

 <p> AUSTRALIA stressed the need to deliver the work plan for the technical experts

 <p> GERMANY reminded delegates this was the first phase of experimentation that could lead to a more permanent institutional structure

<p> IRAN, on behalf of the Asian Group, said the Chair's proposal on the number of TAPs is acceptable, but no consensus on distribution of panel members exists

<p> INDIA said that the SBSTA should take regional groups as the basis, and noted that Asia has both Annex I and non-Annex I countries

<p> AUSTRALIA stressed the need to deliver the work plan for the technical experts

<p> GERMANY reminded delegates this was the first phase of experimentation that could lead to a more permanent institutional structure

 SWITZERLAND noted the IPCC report provides a clear signal, but added that mitigation measures are available and many will cost little

 MALAYSIA asked whether the climate models will have a global or regional basis

 BRAZIL said the SBSTA can make recommendations to the COP to endorse areas the IPCC identified to promote governmental and international action to fill knowledge gaps

 AUSTRALIA noted the number of "no regrets" policies, but said the risk of damage provides rationale for actions beyond "no regrets

 IRAN said the SAR provided an opportunity to consider socioeconomic impacts, technology transfer and policy measures for sustainable economic growth

 <p> ZIMBABWE highlighted the result that developing countries are the most heavily affected and have less adaptation options regarding food, water and human health

 Supported by KENYA and POLAND, she said there is a need to get information to all levels of society and to improve regional participation using local experts

 NIGERIA said the SAR is a preliminary document that the IPCC will continue to develop

 JAPAN highlighted: substantial evidence that warming is occurring; the requirement for future emissions lower than 1990 levels, if concentrations are to stabilize; the suggestion that a significant amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be reduced at small or negligible cost; that diffusion of technology is vital; and that while scientific uncertainty still exists, the possibly huge impact requires action according to the precautionary principle

 <p> CHINA asked whether the SAR's impact assessments were based on the latest projections of mean global surface temperature increase or earlier, higher projections

 CANADA urged the SBSTA to endorse the SAR and bring it to the COP for action

 <p> KUWAIT said agreement on the need to reduce uncertainty means that uncertainty exists

 The PHILIPPINES appreciated the report's acknowledgment that developing countries are going to suffer from the adverse effects of climate change

 KENYA said the report does not say which concentrations could be dangerous and asked if this represented a scientific fact or a policy position

 The US, supported by POLAND, said it would be better to use exact IPCC wording because the SAR is a negotiated text

 Supported by CHINA, KUWAIT and NIGERIA, he added that the SBSTA should only thank the IPCC for its assessment and transmit the synthesis report and the SAR to the COP

 NIGERIA said the conclusions should reflect that the IPCC report is not the only report available

 CHINA said a reference to the IPCC report as "the most authoritative and comprehensive assessment available" should be changed to "useful and comprehensive

 NORWAY said paragraph 2 is not a biased selection and supported its inclusion

 CANADA said the SBSTA must identify key findings in the SAR if it is to provide appropriate advice to the AGBM and the COP

 KENYA supported retention of paragraph 2 using IPCC language

 AUSTRALIA supported retaining the reference to "most authoritative and comprehensive" as well as paragraph 2

 The US, supported by UZBEKISTAN, said IPCC technical reports should address a variety of gas mixes, time horizons and stabilization levels, use simple models to predict mean temperature change and sea-level rise at 10-year intervals, and evaluate the technical feasibility of each profile

 The NETHERLANDS said the documents are already made for policy makers, so there is no need for further simplification of IPCC documents by the SBSTA

 <p> INDIA said the IPCC should continue to synthesize science and technical research, not stray into policy measures or national technologies

 VENEZUELA said the IPCC should look at the social and economic consequences of a protocol or legal instrument of new commitments for Annex I countries and how new commitments can help avoid temperature and sea-level rise

 CHINA said global projections alone are far from enough for countries and regions to formulate policies and strategies

 UGANDA said the question is how SBI and SBSTA can establish regional research institutions, especially in less developed areas like Africa

 ITALY, on behalf of the EU, said the IPCC should continue as the primary body providing independent assessments, reviewing published literature and developing methodologies and guidelines

 <p> KUWAIT said it is important to focus on the economic impacts of any proposals for new commitments, and on the reduction in change in temperature and sea-level rise that can be achieved

 CANADA supported looking at criteria for determining dangerous interference, as well as emphasis on social and economic impacts, especially in developing countries, and on the impact of response options on employment, inflation and other economic factors

 MALAYSIA recommended that SBSTA prepare a list of adaptation technologies and consider mechanisms to enhance dissemination of experience on adaptation technology

 EGYPT said the IPCC should continue to assess impacts on vulnerable regions

 <p> POLAND said guidelines for adaptation measures are needed as well as for inventories

 ARMENIA called for a study of methane emissions from municipal dumps and work on the use of municipal refuse as fuel

<p> ZIMBABWE highlighted the result that developing countries are the most heavily affected and have less adaptation options regarding food, water and human health

<p> CHINA asked whether the SAR's impact assessments were based on the latest projections of mean global surface temperature increase or earlier, higher projections

<p> KUWAIT said agreement on the need to reduce uncertainty means that uncertainty exists

<p> INDIA said the IPCC should continue to synthesize science and technical research, not stray into policy measures or national technologies

<p> KUWAIT said it is important to focus on the economic impacts of any proposals for new commitments, and on the reduction in change in temperature and sea-level rise that can be achieved

<p> POLAND said guidelines for adaptation measures are needed as well as for inventories

 <p> INDIA noted the projected values for emissions of all GHGs are substantially higher than 1990 levels, and fall far short of the Convention's goals

 JAPAN highlighted the need to clearly define the time frame for prospective steps in the guidelines, which should review the performance of policies and measures and should be more comparable

 POLAND said that economies in transition may have trouble submitting national inventory data by 15 April 1996

 CANADA supported the further development of guidelines to improve transparency, consistency, descriptions of policies and measures, and reporting on technology cooperation

 AUSTRALIA supported the Secretariat's proposal to include examples of national circumstances in the second compilation

 URUGUAY expressed concern about the lack of comparability between Annex I national communications

 <p> CHINA, supported by the PHILIPPINES, said no one other than the G-77/China could change the group's position paper

 INDIA said financial support would also be needed for institutional capacity building, including monitoring and research and development for measurement systems

 NIGERIA emphasized the importance of technical capacity building through training and other necessary financial assistance

 ITALY, on behalf of the EU, said the description of policies and measures should include a section on mitigation

 FRANCE asked whether the 1994 base year should be different than Annex I Parties' base year of 1990, and also suggested that aggregation of reports from non-Annex I Parties did not preclude the need to collect or analyze individual countries' reports

 JAPAN said the variety of conditions in developing countries requires flexibility without compromising other values

 CANADA said guidelines should be finalized for recommendation to COP-2 and for early application by some Parties

 INDIA said transparency, comparability and consistency are requirements of science and of all Parties, but are not totally apparent even in Annex I Parties' communications

 CHINA said no Party had achieved transparency, comparability, and consistency, and asked whether is it fair to hold developing countries to standards others have not met

 <p> The PHILIPPINES said flexibility does not mean that Parties pick and choose obligations, but the goal is to deal with difficulties

 MALAYSIA said delegates should not prejudge transparency, comparability and consistency until the SBSTA can evaluate the communications

<p> INDIA noted the projected values for emissions of all GHGs are substantially higher than 1990 levels, and fall far short of the Convention's goals

<p> CHINA, supported by the PHILIPPINES, said no one other than the G-77/China could change the group's position paper

<p> The PHILIPPINES said flexibility does not mean that Parties pick and choose obligations, but the goal is to deal with difficulties

 <p> The NETHERLANDS, on behalf of the OECD, reported on the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI), which was established to assist all interested countries in meeting the objectives of the UNFCCC

 INDIA mentioned several other sources of information available, including databases and newsletters, and highlighted the importance of electronic information technology

 <p> MALAYSIA said it is difficult to make full use of the data available

 JAPAN highlighted activities under the CTI and AIJ

 CANADA said the highest priority is preparing national communications, and supported annual reports on technology assessments

 <p> CHINA disagreed with the suggestion that technology transfer should be linked with AIJ, because AIJ is supplementary and voluntary, whereas technology transfer is an obligation

 <p> IRAN stated that this information should be produced in a manner that covers the demand of countries

<p> The NETHERLANDS, on behalf of the OECD, reported on the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI), which was established to assist all interested countries in meeting the objectives of the UNFCCC

<p> MALAYSIA said it is difficult to make full use of the data available

<p> IRAN stated that this information should be produced in a manner that covers the demand of countries

 CANADA requested that the Secretariat prepare a document on a longer-term programme

 MALAYSIA said the Secretariat should consider how the SBSTA would provide advice on international research programmes, and research and observation systems

 Following the Chair's suggestion to adopt the draft report of SBSTA, CHINA and VENEZUELA objected and made proposals for including specific elements, but the Chair replied that the group was only adopting the structure of report without the substantive elements at this stage, and that all issues would be considered later in the day

 <p> CHINA proposed including a paragraph noting the G-77/China's position paper on guidelines for preparing initial communications from non-Annex I Parties

 The PHILIPPINES requested more time to review the document

 CHINA suggested highlighting transfer of technology and proposed adding a paragraph on Annex II Parties' activities on technology transfer

 <p> MALAYSIA said its proposal had been omitted and added a reference to setting up a one-stop information center, providing financial resources, preparing comprehensive catalogues, disseminating information and assessing the suitability of technology

 INDIA proposed adding a paragraph stating that the SBSTA adopted this document as the basis of guidelines and format for preparation of the initial communications from non-Annex I Parties

 The PHILIPPINES said the proposal intends to send a clear message for further planning and discussion

 <p> GHANA, on behalf of the African Group, expressed disappointment that guidelines for non-Annex I communications were not adopted and that no contact group was established to resolve differences between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties

 CHINA, the EU and the US debated at length proposed language on methods for and calculation of an outcome of the contribution of AIJ projects, with China arguing for removal of "methods

 The PHILIPPINES said the list of major IPCC findings should include adverse effects of climate change, including adaptation and mitigation

 JAPAN said the highlights should mention technical measures that accelerate technology diffusion and transfer

 GHANA, on behalf of the African Group, expressed disappointment at the inability to reach agreement

 <p> The PHILIPPINES said it was not the G-77/China that blocked establishment of the TAPs

 CHINA said the G-77/China paper reflects the serious effort made to facilitate a decision

 <p> JAPAN regretted the lack of decision on TAPs and suggested considering initiating a process with a roster of experts

 Delegates discussed this suggestion, and URUGUAY said the Secretariat could prepare a paper on relevant disciplines for the TAPs

<p> CHINA proposed including a paragraph noting the G-77/China's position paper on guidelines for preparing initial communications from non-Annex I Parties

<p> MALAYSIA said its proposal had been omitted and added a reference to setting up a one-stop information center, providing financial resources, preparing comprehensive catalogues, disseminating information and assessing the suitability of technology

 <p> The NETHERLANDS stressed the importance of exchanging experiences and supported the EU-proposed informal workshop

 NORWAY supported the US call for greater consistency in reviews

 <p> ARGENTINA noted there was no communication from the EU listed in the document

 <p> ARMENIA replaced a reference to returning to "1990" levels with "base year" levels, in light of the COP decision providing flexibility for countries with economies in transition

 Delegates debated a proposal from CHINA for specifying "Annex I" whenever "Parties" were mentioned

<p> The NETHERLANDS stressed the importance of exchanging experiences and supported the EU-proposed informal workshop

<p> ARGENTINA noted there was no communication from the EU listed in the document

<p> ARMENIA replaced a reference to returning to "1990" levels with "base year" levels, in light of the COP decision providing flexibility for countries with economies in transition

 SENEGAL said technical and financial support was vital for non-Annex I Parties' preparation of preliminary national communications

 IRAN said that an over-emphasis on long-term activities must not undermine the short-term activities in developing countries

 <p> INDIA noted that national communications are not just part of a process, but are a basis for sustainable development

 CHINA stressed the need for more financial resources and said that activities should not be confined to information exchange and training, but should provide technical and financial support

 SWITZERLAND stated, on the objective of eliminating obstacles, that care must be used to ensure that all actions are acceptable

 <p> BRAZIL noted the commitment to provide financial resources but said that no resources had been received to date

 PANAMA called for more information on activities so that Parties are not dependent on second-hand news

 CANADA and GERMANY noted the importance of electronic dissemination of information and encouraged further expansion

 SAUDI ARABIA objected to the reference to the adoption of the operational strategy, but FRANCE stated that the phrase was essential

<p> INDIA noted that national communications are not just part of a process, but are a basis for sustainable development

<p> BRAZIL noted the commitment to provide financial resources but said that no resources had been received to date

 GERMANY said the President of the COP has raised this issue at every Bureau meeting since COP-1 and used other opportunities for discussion

 FRANCE noted there is not yet a final decision from the EU and said the group will have to spend a week preparing for a ministerial segment <p> Regarding the composition of the Bureau, the Chair noted a preliminary list of representatives

 <p> MALAYSIA noted there is an enormous amount of information available in many centers and in many forms and said any future compilation on technology transfer should provide sufficient information to explain how the projects or activities fully meet the objective of the Convention

 CHINA noted that communications from Annex II Parties failed to elaborate on technology transfer and said the provisions on technology transfer in the Convention have not been satisfactorily implemented

 SWITZERLAND described an international expert meeting for assessing and meeting technology needs, which was co-sponsored by the Netherlands

 CANADA urged addressing all relevant sectors and GHGs in the reports and specifying those intended to reduce GHGs and those to enhance sinks

 IRAN noted that the definition of technology transfer in the report fails to include know-how

 <p> INDIA said that technology transfer was envisaged as a primary mover in the Convention's implementation, but the spotlight has shifted to the softer side of technology transfer such as capacity building and information networks

 The NETHERLANDS said the Convention should focus on all issues, but take a phased approach

 SLOVENIA noted that Annex I activities alone are not enough

 KENYA noted that the subject has not been adequately considered and said a high level of transparency is needed

 FRANCE noted contradictory messages condemning and calling for French aid

<p> MALAYSIA noted there is an enormous amount of information available in many centers and in many forms and said any future compilation on technology transfer should provide sufficient information to explain how the projects or activities fully meet the objective of the Convention

<p> INDIA said that technology transfer was envisaged as a primary mover in the Convention's implementation, but the spotlight has shifted to the softer side of technology transfer such as capacity building and information networks

 IRAN, on behalf of the Asian Group, said that if there were any allocation, the Asian Group was the largest and should have a proportional share of the Bureau

 SENEGAL asked if this action meant the Bureau will be expanded

 SENEGAL replied that the quality of leadership was not the issue, but principle of expanding the Bureau

 VENEZUELA asked whether the group should open this debate and said there will be a Bureau meeting in due course

 MALI endorsed the comments of Senegal and asked if the rules of procedure can be indefinitely extended

 URUGUAY said there were no criteria on whether the Chairs of the subsidiary bodies has to sit on the Bureau and asked if there had been any progress on the rules of procedure concerning the composition of Bureau with 10 or 11 members

 NIGERIA said if the Bureau is to be expanded the African Group will make its own request because it has the most members

 The NETHERLANDS noted that the SBSTA refers to the G-77/China document as the basis for adoption, whereas this proposal refers to it as the basis for implementation

 INDIA said the G-77/China proposal provides more details and places the SBSTA's work in the context of implementation

 <p> The PHILIPPINES said the G-77/China wanted to tailor a response to the SBI

<p> The PHILIPPINES said the G-77/China wanted to tailor a response to the SBI

 SAUDI ARABIA, supported by VENEZUELA and KUWAIT, objected that no new or substantial issues were slated for discussion and questioned whether the meeting warranted ministerial attendance

 GHANA, on behalf of the African Group, said the Convention had gathered momentum since COP-1 and a ministerial segment will continue this

 <p> JAPAN stated that many Asian countries favor a ministerial segment

 UGANDA said a ministerial segment would allow an exchange of views and experiences and could give Parties the will to move forward on Convention responsibilities

 TURKEY, on behalf of WEOG, said the group will maintain the current Vice Presidency of the SBI

 IRAN, on behalf of the Asian Group, said his group has a nominee and had also asked for a Vice Presidency of the COP

<p> JAPAN stated that many Asian countries favor a ministerial segment

 CHINA said the Asian Group had selected Thailand and Saudi Arabia to provide its representatives, so he could not accept the invitation

 NIGERIA recalled that Bolin had said, during SBSTA, that there were uncertainties inherent in the SAR

 CANADA supported the findings in the first set of SBSTA conclusions and noted that they seemed to have the support of most Parties

 JAPAN supported the SAR findings and said specific P&amp;M should be clarified

 <p> CANADA reported on the Annex I experts group project on P&amp;M for common action, which is developing a methodology for evaluating their effectiveness

 ITALY, on behalf of the EU, said the EU has begun investigating 11 areas of P&amp;M, identifying indicators, evaluating targets, and assessing emission reductions toward a study for AGBM 4

 <p> CHILE supported Germany’s proposed approach for a flat rate emissions reduction, noting it contained clear measures and was aimed at CO2 emissions without precluding other instruments

 AUSTRALIA said P&amp;M in a legal instrument should complement national programmes

 <p> CANADA said the IPCC SAR suggests that significant opportunities are available for Parties to take actions, so it is important to identify P&amp;M that reinforce the positive relationship between economics and the environment, such as energy efficiency and pollution controls

 <p> SWITZERLAND said fluorocarbons and HFCs should be included as a sector, as a possible growing source of emissions that are persistent in atmosphere compared to other gases

 <p> The NETHERLANDS said there are reasons for harmonizing P&amp;M because some measures cannot be taken at the national level without distorting the global market

 IRAN said the AGBM should cooperate with the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Energy Agency (IEA), OPEC, UNIDO and others to assess which P&amp;M are effective and efficient

 ICELAND said differentiated commitments can imply a more complicated agreement, but reduction targets are possible in a more cost-effective manner if different national circumstances are recognized

 UGANDA said Annex I countries must take seriously their commitment to transfer technology and financial resources to developing countries

 <p> MALAYSIA said it is hard to see the need for differentiation between countries

 <p> JAPAN said work on CO2 emissions will be required as the ultimate solution

 <p> KUWAIT said several delegations had referred to the SAR and selective portions and attempted to related them to QELROs

 <p> INDIA echoed the Republic of Korea’s apprehensions on the implications of P&amp;M on trade

 KENYA stressed availability cost and the potential for strengthening renewable technology

 ARGENTINA said that subsidies for agriculture that affect GHGs must be reduced

 EGYPT said that QELROs are the real yardstick for measuring the Convention’s success

 <p> INDIA, supported by CHINA, noted that there were no experts nominated from some countries

 CHINA noted that groups preparing documents on technology transfer should note that technology transfer refers to environmentally sound technologies, as defined in Agenda 21; full systems of technologies and know-how, which fall within national priorities

<p> The G-77/CHINA, supported by INDIA and CHINA, stressed the importance of this topic for all countries, and expressed deep concern over the continuing lack of progress and the fact that most technology transfer is being undertaken within the AIJ framework

” <p> COSTA RICA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, said that review mechanisms of the SBI and the SBSTA should be used in the AG13 process

 CHINA noted that an MCP should be invoked only by Parties, involve discussions between Parties and should not “pass judgment” on implementation efforts

 CANADA said an MCP could involve a representative group of Parties with expert input, if needed

 JAPAN noted that the process should only involve a limited number of Parties, otherwise the SBI should be involved

 CANADA said that Parties should be free to raise their own implementation issues

 The PHILIPPINES cautioned against derogating the balance within the Convention and said an MCP should be a consultative process and nothing else

 CHINA reiterated that it was not urgent to establish an MCP

 <p> Regarding an MCP’s area of expertise, MOROCCO said that legal, economic, social and technical issues should be addressed

 SWITZERLAND said technical and scientific issues could be addressed unless it would duplicate other bodies’ work

 The US and CANADA suggested drawing from a roster of experts for consultation

 CHINA and KUWAIT said it is premature to draw conclusions

 AUSTRIA noted that if an MCP advises Parties on solving problems then questions of individual performance must be part of the procedure

 VENEZUELA said that interpretation should be left to the COP

 FRANCE responded that the possible role in interpretation should not be excluded

 AUSTRALIA said an MCP could play a role in interpreting or clarifying obligations through practical assistance rather than judicial-style interpretation

 CHINA stated that many differences of opinion are due to misinformation and an MCP could allow Parties to exchange views on interpretation

 MOROCCO said an MCP should adopt recommendations and report to the COP independently of the SBSTA and the SBI

 KUWAIT noted the importance of identifying the areas of concern for an MCP and said that many of the issues presented here fall under existing bodies

 On the relationship between Articles 13 and 14, JAPAN, VENEZUELA, MOROCCO and SLOVENIA noted that Articles 13 and 14 are clearly different

 CHILE noted that Article 14 requires Parties to settle disputes through negotiation or “any other peaceful means” and an MCP could provide this type of advisory service

 CANADA, ITALY, the EU, ZIMBABWE, SLOVENIA, the PHILIPPINES and CHILE supported a standing committee

 JAPAN preferred an <i>ad hoc </i>group to address issues as identified by the SBI

 The NETHERLANDS cautioned that associating the committee too closely with the SBI would hamper its freedom of movement

 KUWAIT stated that the creation of another institution would be burdensome and noted that any group formed should be linked to the SBI

 CANADA, the EU, ZIMBABWE, ITALY, MOROCCO, the PHILIPPINES and CHILE called for equitable geographic representation

 The PHILIPPINES and CHINA proposed forming an open- ended group, but cautioned that limiting the size could also limit equitable geographical distribution

 JAPAN supported using other criteria and the NETHERLANDS supported further consideration of <i>ex officio</i> representation for SBI and SBSTA

 ZIMBABWE stated that individual Parties should decide whether committee members are delegates, national NGOs or others

 CHINA preferred governmental officials who are experts on Article 13

 ITALY proposed ensuring stability through the election of a president and a vice-president, and appointing members on the principle of rotation, with two-year memberships

” The PHILIPPINES supported the G- 77/CHINA and called for reference to Article 11

 JAPAN then reported on work of the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI) to strengthen National Action Plans, increase use of existing climate friendly technology and improve new technology

 A number of countries, including the EU, the US and CANADA, stressed the importance of the CTI

 The G-77/CHINA urged removal of restrictions on technology transfer

 MALAYSIA said that many technologies are only available commercially

 The EU, CANADA and THAILAND also stressed the role of the private sector in technology transfer

 MAURITIUS said that governments must approve transfer of technologies from commercial firms

 The MARSHALL ISLANDS and CHINA said that solutions do not lie with the private sector

 <p> The G-77/CHINA, supported by KIRIBATI, MALAYSIA, NIGERIA, the MARSHALL ISLANDS, THAILAND, INDIA and TANZANIA, said fulfillment of developing countries’ commitments depends on the provision of resources and technology transfer and is the basis for all negotiations, including AGBM discussions

 <p> THAILAND and INDIA noted the importance of endogenous capacity building in developing countries

 A number of countries, including the EU, the G-77/CHINA, MALAYSIA, CANADA, SAUDI ARABIA, NIGERIA and THAILAND, emphasized the importance of specialized information centers and networks

 INDIA also advocated use of existing technology information centers

 AUSTRALIA said that its technology transfer efforts coincide with needs outlined by CHINA: environmentally sound, appropriate for users, driven by recipient countries, and involving hard and soft technology

 CHINA and the PHILIPPINES wanted to add that it is mainly the role of Annex II Parties to carry out such activities

 CANADA and the US did not agree

 The G-77/CHINA added that many Parties urged SBSTA to set up ITAPs without delay

 MALAYSIA added that the SBSTA shall address this issue at its next session

<p> The G-77/CHINA, supported by KIRIBATI, MALAYSIA, NIGERIA, the MARSHALL ISLANDS, THAILAND, INDIA and TANZANIA, said fulfillment of developing countries’ commitments depends on the provision of resources and technology transfer and is the basis for all negotiations, including AGBM discussions

 BURKINA FASO and ALGERIA stressed that procedures to deal with the GEF can be very cumbersome and that efforts made by non-Annex I Parties must be recognized

 <p> The G-77/CHINA stressed the importance of the review, but noted that the document was received rather late and full consideration could not be completed immediately

 CHINA said the disbursement process should be streamlined and more flexible

 COLOMBIA said a review of the financial mechanism this year is premature and more time is needed to examine the results of the GEF’s investment projects

 IRAN stated that one session would not be sufficient for adequate consideration of the review process

 CANADA said that in addition to discrete projects, the review should also address elements, such as the GEF’s ability to cooperate with other international organizations, leverage resources and “mainstream” environmental concerns

 KUWAIT noted that COP- 2 took note of, “but did not adopt” the Geneva Ministerial Declaration and that a later reference to the Geneva Ministerial Declaration should be coupled with a reference to another statement adopted by those delegations that did not support the Declaration

 CHINA said that the reference to avoiding greenhouse gas emissions was unacceptable because they occur naturally

 <p> The G-77/CHINA, supported by CHINA and BOTSWANA, expressed concern about the late distribution of documents for the current session

 At the close of SBSTA-5, a statement was made on behalf of the G-77/CHINA expressing concern about this recommendation

 <p> CHINA, supported by the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, INDIA, BURKINA FASO, MALAYSIA and the G-77/CHINA, proposed stating that any new substantive proposals must be communicated in draft form to all Parties six months before the ministerial segment

 CHINA amended his proposal to request communication from “six months” to “well in advance” of COP-3

” MALAYSIA stated that he was caught in surprise at COP-2 and felt an “air of conspiracy

” ARGENTINA reminded delegates that the SBI can provide recommendations to the COP but cannot decide what the COP will do

 The US, supported by GERMANY and the UK, proposed that the SBI should keep the arrangements of the conference under review and recommends that any new, substantive proposals concerning these arrangements be communicated well in advance of the start of the conference

 CHINA said this did not solve the problem of transparency and noted that “arrangements” and “proposals” are not the same thing

 MALAYSIA proposed noting that all action be “in accordance with normal UN practice

<p> The G-77/CHINA, supported by CHINA and BOTSWANA, expressed concern about the late distribution of documents for the current session

 <p> CHINA warned against duplication of existing mechanisms and said that the FCCC should not copy the non-compliance procedure under the Montreal Protocol

 UZBEKISTAN envisaged the MCP as a process that renders consultative services to Parties and called for a special group with wide geographic representation to address issues of law, economics, ecology and social issues

 The EU, supported by SWITZERLAND, called for an advisory regime to assist implementation, which would have a broad competence but not encroach on other bodies

 CHINA noted that an MCP should take action prior to, rather than following, implementation

 The US, supported by JAPAN, said that including scientific and technological expertise could lead to duplication of the SBSTA’s work

 JAPAN said that there is broad agreement on an advisory role

 CHILE noted that Article 14 calls for settlement of disputes through negotiations or “any other peaceful means,” and that an MCP could fill the latter role

 CHINA called for further definitions

 <p> Several countries, including the EU, CHILE and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, said the MCP’s objective should be to find solutions to problems of implementation, to provide assistance to Parties and to prevent disputes from arising

 CHINA, supported by ITALY, the EU and FINLAND, said that promoting “implementation” was more appropriate than promoting “compliance" since an MCP’s function should be advisory

 On expertise, the EU, supported by CHILE, noted an MCP should address any questions that could arise in any discipline and members should have sufficient expertise to ask the right questions to experts outside the group

 CHILE, CHINA, the EU, SWITZERLAND and SLOVENIA supported a standing body with a stable and fixed basis

 To avoid greater bureaucracy, CHILE suggested establishing a small body where members would be selected for a specified time and that could meet concurrently with other subsidiary bodies

 IRAN spoke against creating a new institution, stressed its budgetary implications and noted the problem that additional meetings pose for developing countries

 The EU and SWITZERLAND suggested a standing committee, which would report to the COP

 <p> CHINA, supported by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and IRAN, stated that substance and functions of an MCP should be discussed before its form, and suggested that an MCP could be an <i>ad hoc </i>committee

 SWITZERLAND and the EU cautioned that the COP should not be obliged to take a decision on every MCP item

 CHINA preferred that the COP govern the process but that reports and recommendations are sent to the COP via the SBI

 CHINA cautioned that Article 13 states an MCP would only be available to Parties, “on their own request”

 The EU and CHINA said the COP should establish an MCP process

 <p> In discussing this proposal, the EU, supported by SLOVENIA, proposed that an MCP could be a “standing” group

 CHINA, the EU, ZIMBABWE, FRANCE and SWITZERLAND said the main objective should be to provide assistance to individual Parties rather than to the COP

” The EU and EGYPT insisted on bracketing the US proposal

 <p> On an MCP’s functions, FRANCE wished to reserve the opportunity for the COP to entrust tasks to an MCP and said a five-member MCP could be feasible considering the likelihood of additional <i>ex officio</i> members

 In response to concerns expressed by MALAYSIA and IRAN, the Chair suggested that MCP meetings occur in conjunction with COP and subsidiary body meetings

 CHINA suggested a new paragraph stating that an MCP’s function should be “to provide assistance to Parties in relation to difficulties they encounter in the course of implementation including: (1) clarification of questions and (2) assistance to the developing countries Parties in accordance with Article 12

 <p> The US and ITALY expressed their concern about adding the Chinese proposal

<p> CHINA warned against duplication of existing mechanisms and said that the FCCC should not copy the non-compliance procedure under the Montreal Protocol

<p> The US and ITALY expressed their concern about adding the Chinese proposal

 <p> CHINA, IRAN and MOROCCO, on behalf of the African Group, requested clarification on the division of tasks between non-groups and asked whether the non-groups would address P&amp;Ms and QELROs

 The G-77/CHINA, supported by the EU, MALAYSIA and the AFRICAN GROUP urged for a limited number of additional groups, given the constraints facing small delegations

 CHINA also cautioned AGBM not to “waste time” on issues related to institutions and definitions

 IRAN said the EU proposal was premature and SAUDI ARABIA urged that AGBM complete a negotiating text and not leave work for the Chair

<p> CHINA, IRAN and MOROCCO, on behalf of the African Group, requested clarification on the division of tasks between non-groups and asked whether the non-groups would address P&amp;Ms and QELROs

 The proposal by POLAND, BULGARIA, ESTONIA, LATVIA and SLOVENIA, stated that QELROs should be legally binding

 <p> The G-77/CHINA urged AGBM to adhere to the Convention and the Berlin Mandate and refrain from developing new commitments for non-Annex I Parties

 The G-77/CHINA proposal calls for: ensuring that P&amp;Ms have no adverse socio-economic impacts on developing countries; establishing a concrete compensation mechanism for damage in developing countries arising from implementation of response measures; and setting QELROS within specified time frames, such as 2005, 2010 and 2020

 <p> FRANCE proposed differentiating the commitments of Annex I Parties according to present emission levels of greenhouse gases per inhabitant and per GDP

 <p> ICELAND proposed differentiation and the following parameters for identifying differences in national circumstances: GHG emission intensity and level, share of renewable energy sources and GDP per capita

 MALAYSIA commented that parameters are changing regularly

 MAURITIUS inquired about a supervisory mechanism for this formula

 VENEZUELA, supported by COSTA RICA, suggested “historical responsibility” as an additional criterion for differentiation

 SWITZERLAND added “past efforts” by countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as another criterion

 IRAN also proposes a compensation mechanism for adverse impacts of response measures

 Responding to ZIMBABWE, IRAN noted that its proposed compensation mechanism is designed to compensate countries that incur losses due to polices and measures stipulated by the AGBM legal instrument and does not provide funds for countries that incur damages resulting directly from climate change

 IRAN replied that further details would be supplied at a later date

 <p> AUSTRALIA proposed: a collective reduction objective for “Annex A” Parties, which are those listed in Annex I of the FCCC; mitigation activities that result in equal percentage changes in per capita economic welfare among “Annex A” Parties; differentiated commitments; use of indicators in the negotiation process; and further consideration of market-based approaches such as emissions trading and joint implementation

 Responding to MALAYSIA, AUSTRALIA said formula approaches are too simplistic to account for wide variations among countries’ circumstances and emphasized that differentiation is not a means to delay action, but to achieve fairness

 CHINA expressed concern that emissions trading would replace government commitments with activities of firms and individuals

 <p> KUWAIT, NIGERIA and SAUDI ARABIA supported the proposal by the G-77/China

 ITALY pointed out that the Convention does not include a compensation mechanism

 SAUDI ARABIA, supported by IRAN, noted Article 4

 KUWAIT noted his disappointment that the developed countries' proposals do not mention any provision for developing countries' compensation

 <p> CANADA noted that economic change in energy sources has occurred over the past century and will continue regardless of a protocol

 THAILAND suggested that AGBM not spend time discussing emissions trading

 <p> UZBEKISTAN proposed differentiation for Annex I Parties, according to the level of economic development and GDP per capita

<p> The G-77/CHINA urged AGBM to adhere to the Convention and the Berlin Mandate and refrain from developing new commitments for non-Annex I Parties

<p> FRANCE proposed differentiating the commitments of Annex I Parties according to present emission levels of greenhouse gases per inhabitant and per GDP

 <p> SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA said the comments from Parties contained in document FCCC/AGBM/1997/2/Add

 CHINA also expressed confusion regarding references to Annexes X, A and B in the proposals and urged Parties to refrain from developing new categories

 JAPAN suggested that Annex I Parties adopt P&amp;Ms according to national circumstances, in the areas of efficient use of energy, low-carbon energy, technological development and cooperation, and enhancement of sinks

 <p> The EU, supported by SWITZERLAND, favored legally binding P&amp;Ms and highlighted his proposed Annexes A (common P&amp;Ms), B (coordinated P&amp;Ms that receive high priority) and C (priority P&amp;Ms for inclusion in national programmes)

 POLAND and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION supported a menu approach, which takes account of various economic structures and attempts to maintain a high and stable rate of economic growth

 The G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, stressed that P&amp;Ms should not have adverse impacts on developing country Parties

 IRAN stressed the need for a section on general commitments and guiding measures in the protocol

 <p> CHINA reiterated that the Berlin Mandate requires an elaboration of P&amp;Ms whose objectives should be clear at this stage

 The Chair, supported by IRAN, said these concerns are better addressed when considering QELROs

<p> SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA said the comments from Parties contained in document FCCC/AGBM/1997/2/Add

<p> The EU, supported by SWITZERLAND, favored legally binding P&amp;Ms and highlighted his proposed Annexes A (common P&amp;Ms), B (coordinated P&amp;Ms that receive high priority) and C (priority P&amp;Ms for inclusion in national programmes)

<p> CHINA reiterated that the Berlin Mandate requires an elaboration of P&amp;Ms whose objectives should be clear at this stage

 SWITZERLAND stressed that there is no good unique indicator that can take into account national circumstances and said that the logical starting point of the discussion is agreement on the quantity to differentiate

 GERMANY urged countries to enrich progress by making concrete proposals regarding numbers for significant overall reductions and the contributions that countries intend to make toward these goals

 <p> GERMANY stated that differentiation within the EU was not based on indicators, because indicators do not reflect political reality

 <p> GERMANY, referring to the EU experience, suggested making a joint commitment for a future protocol, setting common targets for Annex I Parties and deciding how to share them

 AUSTRALIA asked how differentiation was achieved within the EU and noted this could set an example for Annex I countries on the road to Kyoto

 ICELAND stressed the need to reach conclusions on differentiation before Kyoto

<p> GERMANY stated that differentiation within the EU was not based on indicators, because indicators do not reflect political reality

<p> GERMANY, referring to the EU experience, suggested making a joint commitment for a future protocol, setting common targets for Annex I Parties and deciding how to share them

 SWITZERLAND stressed that each Annex I Party should adopt legally binding QELROs

 NIGERIA requested the deletion of a reference to the Geneva Ministerial Declaration, which calls for legally-binding QELROs for Annex I Parties within specified time-frames with respect to sources and removal of sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol

 He emphasized that the Declaration was not adopted and noted that the G-77/CHINA proposal to set “realistic and achievable QELROs in a comprehensive manner" reflects its substance

 PERU referred to the Geneva Declaration and called for reduction target for the year 2005

 HUNGARY supported the US’s long-term goal for atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations

 <p> NORWAY and ICELAND withdrew their proposals, as they were contained in other proposals

 CHINA said that the text should only include issues on which agreement has been reached

 JAPAN did not agree and called for retention of its proposal that QELROs would be set for C02 only

 <p> The G-77/CHINA called for: flexibility for Annex I countries due to their differences in starting points; no adverse effects of P&amp;Ms on developing countries; and no further commitments for developing countries

 CHINA called for all other Annex I countries to propose QELROs with time frames as the EU has done

 He opposed emissions borrowing and, with HUNGARY, opposed a new category for countries that are rapidly developing

 NORWAY noted that ambitious targets via legally binding commitments can only be achieved through efforts such as differentiation, equitable burden sharing, comprehensive treatment of sources and sinks, and coordination of economic instruments

 AUSTRALIA insisted that its complete text on differentiation be reproduced in the document

 <p> On the issue of “flexibility ,” MALAYSIA,<i> </i>supported by CHINA, requested deletion of the entire section on flexibility

 UZBEKISTAN called for the retention of text noting that JI can serve as an instrument to allow technology transfer on a more beneficial basis

 SWITZERLAND supported retaining its proposal that: JI may contribute up to 50% to meeting a country’s fulfillment of commitments; JI may begin in 2000; JI can also take place with non-Parties to the Protocol

 PERU requested retaining JI in the text, until the review at the end of the year

 SAUDI ARABIA and NIGERIA requested retaining paragraphs relating to loss of income

<p> NORWAY and ICELAND withdrew their proposals, as they were contained in other proposals

<p> The G-77/CHINA called for: flexibility for Annex I countries due to their differences in starting points; no adverse effects of P&amp;Ms on developing countries; and no further commitments for developing countries

<p> On the issue of “flexibility ,” MALAYSIA,<i> </i>supported by CHINA, requested deletion of the entire section on flexibility

 IRAN inquired about the possibility of elaborating on each proposal

 <p> POLAND requested that each reference to a new Annex specify which Parties will be included

<p> POLAND requested that each reference to a new Annex specify which Parties will be included

 MOROCCO, on behalf of the African group, reported the following nominees: Mr

 JAMAICA thanked the African group for this offer and requested that it be recorded

 HUNGARY supported using a three-gas basket, and addressing the three additional gases later

 EGYPT reserved the right to consult within the G-77/China, which will provide a joint statement

 TANZANIA highlighted the G-77/China proposal, which would call upon Parties to reduce emissions of three gases and make efforts to control and phase out the other three

 NORWAY noted its support for the proposal by the Chair and said that methodologies were available to work on the basis of six GHGs

 CHINA reiterated the G-77/China’s preference for a gas-by-gas approach

 SWITZERLAND said that it originally made a proposal based on three GHGs, but favored the inclusion of all GHGs not covered by the Montreal Protocol, including HFCs, PFCs, and SF</font><font face="Tahoma" size="1"><sub>6</sub></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">

 POLAND suggested that additional GHGs could be included at a later stage

 BRAZIL noted that long-lived gases required the attention of the AGBM and hoped that consensus could be reached in this respect

 BRAZIL and ICELAND indicated that the issue of sinks needed to be sorted out before settling targets for QELROs

 BRAZIL noted the value of the third option as a basis for compromise

 The G-77/CHINA said the assumption of a consensus on budgeting could be premature

 CHINA said the budget concept has been introduced along with a string of extraneous issues

 A text submitted by the G-77/CHINA, setting out six reasons for rejecting the budget concept, had been suppressed and did not appear in the Chair’s revised negotiating text

 EGYPT invited the Chair to present a balanced proposal

 The G-77/ CHINA objected to the inclusion of a reference to non-Annex I Parties

" The G-77/CHINA and others said it was premature to decide a name before the content of the protocol

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The G-77/CHINA noted that developing countries are the most vulnerable to climate change and the least able to adapt, and are committed to modify trends in human-induced emissions through the principle of common but differentiated responsibility

 ARGENTINA and AOSIS supported the draft decision

 On election of officers other than President, delegates elected Bakary Kante SENEGAL) SBI Chair, a representative of IRAN SBI Vice Chair, George Manful (GHANA), T

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The G-77/CHINA, supported by INDIA, BRAZIL, CHINA, MALAYSIA, SAUDI ARABIA, EGYPT, INDONESIA and AOSIS, objected to discussing evolution of commitments

 INDIA cited the decision of COP-1 that the Berlin Mandate be confined to reviewing the commitments of Annex I countries on strengthening developed countries’ commitments to GHG reductions and operationalization of resources transfer

 BRAZIL noted that its proposal is useful, while the evolution clause is an extraneous distraction from the main purpose of reducing the emissions of the main Annex I polluters

 CHINA said the evolution proposal is: outside the scope of the Berlin Mandate process, which prevails until its outcome is adopted at COP-3; a political move to let some countries evade their responsibilities; intended to destroy the FCCC’s principle of common but differentiated responsibilities; and intended to lead to the failure of COP- 3

 CHINA noted that efforts to advance existing commitments are handicapped by a lack of resources and called for a substantial increase in the GEF replenishment

 SWITZERLAND, supported by the US, said that GEF should be established as the permanent FCCC financial mechanism

 The G-77/CHINA referred to the provision of financial resources and the transfer of technology as fundamental to implementation of the Convention by non-Annex I Parties

 The PHILIPPINES mentioned experiencing problems with implementing agencies and said that they should be more aware of decisions taken by the GEF Council

 INDIA, BHUTAN, BANGLADESH and KIRIBATI highlighted the importance of obtaining GEF financing for national communications

 CHINA, supported by INDIA and IRAN, observed two tendencies: developed countries are only interested in transfer of technical information, while developing countries deem technology transfer on non-commercial and preferential terms most important; and some countries emphasize market mechanisms

 JAPAN outlined the Kyoto Initiative to strengthen assistance for developing countries in their efforts to combat global warming, to be operated through the national Official Development Assistance program

 INDIA, supported by IRAN, called for the operationalization of the FCCC provisions relating to state-of-the-art environmentally sound technologies (EST), with supporting provisions in the new legal instrument

 ZIMBABWE outlined her country’s difficulties with basic economic development and the financial impact of El Niño

 IRAN identified obstacles facing developing countries seeking transfers of technology at their own expense due to restrictions imposed by developed countries

 AOSIS, with CHINA and ZIMBABWE, stated that deliberation of this item is premature given that it is unclear what the actions taken under the Berlin Mandate process will accomplish

 CHINA disagreed, saying that the review is independent of the outcome in Kyoto and noting the Article 4

 CANADA expressed uncertainty as to what the review would accomplish

 IRAN, TURKEY and KUWAIT supported the proposal

 The EU and AUSTRALIA maintained that Turkey should indicate willingness to undertake Protocol obligations under Article 10 before its deletion from the Annexes

 TURKEY noted that questions remain unanswered on the Protocol’s proposed Article 10 and requested that ministers discuss the matter on 10 December

 VENEZUELA said the amendment and its provisional application must be considered separately

 The EU, supported by the US and JAPAN, said donors should not place their resources in the hands of the COP

" NIGERIA said linkages between the two proposals must be considered

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Following a proposal by CROATIA, delegates discussed the status of Yugoslavia in relation to the Convention

 AUSTRALIA proposed a new option for a fully comprehensive approach

 JAPAN said his basic approach continues to be the gross approach

 CANADA said Option C does not cover conservation of currently managed forests or agrarian practices and provides no incentive for biodiversity

 BARBADOS supported Option C

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The MARSHALL ISLANDS, supported by GRENADA, cautioned against the uncertainties connected with measuring other activities and preferred putting them in Paragraph 3

 CANADA and NORWAY noted their preference for Option A, saying the uncertainties are overdrawn

 BRAZIL, supported by COSTA RICA, favored Option C as in the original Chair’s text, or dropping the whole Article

 ICELAND, URUGUAY, CANADA, MEXICO, COSTA RICA and NEW ZEALAND supported the US’s concern that Option C refers to only a limited number of activities that can contribute to sinks

 URUGUAY proposed adding “forest management, reforestation and any other forestry activity

” MEXICO suggested “forest management and forest conservation” and COSTA RICA proposed “natural forest regeneration,” and cautioned against allowing sink activities to disappear during the review discussed in Paragraph 3

 ICELAND called for giving Parties credit for the changes occurring during a target year or budget period

 NORWAY, supported by NEW ZEALAND, added brackets around “since 1990” in Option C, as in Options A and B

 GRENADA queried how to measure 1990 sinks now if not already done and suggested giving a negative credit to countries when sinks are destroyed

 ARGENTINA supported Option C, noting its relationship to forest conservation, the Convention to Combat Desertification and recovery of soils

 VENEZUELA said the US amendments would reduce its reluctance regarding Option C

 URUGUAY said the US amendments sought sustainable development

 CANADA supported the modified Option C, as did HONDURAS, who supported Iceland on including soil productivity

 BRAZIL and SAMOA expressed strong disagreement, SAMOA preferring to bracket "deforestation or harvesting

" JAPAN supported the original Option C, but not with the US amendments, which tremendously increased ambiguities and uncertainties

 BARBADOS did not support Option C

 PERU supported Option C but expressed doubts regarding methodology for forest management

 GRENADA did not understand how conservation of forests improves the uptake of a sink

 BRAZIL said the question is: what are man-made activities for which credits should be given to increase emissions? He compared the 6 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon emitted from fossil fuel and 1 Gt from land use change to natural uptake of 2 Gt by oceans and 2 Gt on continental surfaces

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">On Article 4 (the EU “bubble”), NORWAY reported consultations had made progress by clarification and concession from the EU and the proposal would be amended

 On Article 10 (voluntary commitments), MEXICO reported that delegates had expressed an interest in cooperating on the issue, but there were no indications that all regional groups are interested in contact group discussions

 Delegates accepted an offer by ARGENTINA to host COP-4 and subsidiary body meetings, 2-13 November 1998, in Buenos Aires

 BRAZIL noted the proposal's political element: that future objectives be established in terms of global mean surface temperature change, as a mechanism for apportioning the burden

 Supported by HUNGARY, the US, CANADA, the EU, POLAND, SLOVENIA, AUSTRALIA, SWITZERLAND, and JAPAN, he introduced a draft text that, inter alia: notes Annex I Party commitments through 2014; considers that future Annex I commitments beyond that date should comprise the widest possible participation in binding action; recognizes the dependence of inception of non-Annex I Parties’ legally binding emissions limitations commitments on Annex I Parties' implementation, particularly of Kyoto Protocol QELROs; agrees there should be further QELROs for Annex I Parties and “quantified emission limitation objectives” for other Parties, except least developed countries; and establishes a process to set the commitments, to be concluded by 2002

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The G-77/CHINA, supported by THAILAND, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN, COLOMBIA, MALAYSIA, NICARAGUA, HONDURAS, SYRIA, GHANA, TOGO, LAOS, KUWAIT, GRENADA, BOTSWANA, BAHRAIN, MALI, CHILE, PERU, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, NIGERIA, BANGLADESH, KENYA, MOROCCO, ZIMBABWE, INDONESIA, URUGUAY, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, PHILIPPINES, VENEZUELA, COSTA RICA, GAMBIA, ARGENTINA, and SOUTH AFRICA on behalf of Southern African Development Community (SADC), said equity and common but differentiated responsibility are keys to success

" INDIA objected to depriving developing countries of equitable environmental room to grow

 BRAZIL said one developed country statement had implied "if you don't deliver, we won't deliver," to which he replied "until you deliver, we don't discuss

" CHINA recalled the performance of Annex I Parties in meeting existing commitments and warned the EU: “beware of your bubble

 While acknowledging efforts by developing countries to address their emissions, JAPAN pointed to the need for further participation in the future

 CANADA said that the sequencing of commitments had worked under other agreements

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The G-77/CHINA said the New Zealand proposal should be dropped and that the group would not participate in a contact group as a matter of principle

 The G-77/CHINA said there is no agreement

 The G-77/CHINA said that during informal consultations, it had combined its proposal with the EU's and produced Alternative A, under which the rules of the Convention apply to the protocol mutatis mutandis except as may otherwise be decided by consensus by the COP

 The G-77/CHINA said any figure in excess of 50% is unacceptable

 <p> The G-77/CHINA objected to the definition of "defined amount" and supported Alternative C, which calls for QELROs within time frames such as 2005, 2010 and 2020

 CHINA objected to the omission of crucial elements of targets and timetables

 <p> NORWAY summarized the draft on Article 4, the EU "bubble

 <p> IRAN reported on negotiations on minimizing the adverse effects of climate change through policies and measures

 The PHILIPPINES, for the G-77/CHINA, said there should not be two sets of guidelines to the financial mechanism

 CHINA rejected any attempt to rewrite FCCC Article 4

 The PHILIPPINES, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA and PERU requested more time for the G-77/China to consult on the text because of the links between this paragraph and other outstanding issues, particularly those referring to the advancement of commitments under Article 4

 <p> CANADA introduced text containing seven paragraphs

 <p> INDIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA and supported by CHINA and INDONESIA, reiterated its objection to the concept of emissions trading, stating that it is extraneous to the Berlin Mandate and would not lead to GHG emissions limitation and reduction

 The MARSHALL ISLANDS, COSTA RICA and URUGUAY said they were ready to adopt the existing draft text

 CANADA said there is an inconsistency in the proposals treatment of harvesting, which would cause Canada enormous pain, and reforestation, which would not offset the penalty from harvesting

 MEXICO asked the Chair to include conservation activities in the consideration of a definition of sinks

 JAPAN, BARBADOS, RUSSIA, the US, CANADA, CUBA and JAMAICA supported the text

 NEW ZEALAND, supported by AUSTRALIA, the US and NORWAY, called for an earlier text to be kept as an option for ministers

 TRINIDAD and TOBAGO, with TUVALU, said the annexes would be problematic

 RUSSIA suggested dealing with the six gases basket in the second commitment period

 ICELAND, supported by NORWAY and the EU, objected to the US proposal because some countries had already made efforts to reduce their emission of gases in the second basket

 INDIA said the G- 77/CHINA wished to revisit the issue after announcements on QELROs numbers

 <p> CANADA, suppported by NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIA and the US, asked that its emissions trading text be substituted for Article 6, noting its guidelines and a section assigning responsibility to Parties for all transactions, including those by intermediaries

 The G-77/CHINA and URUGUAY requested deletion of the article, but said the text could remain under consideration

 TOGO, supported by MALAYSIA, proposed adjourning until numbers were proposed

 CHINA replied that until QELROs are resolved, the protocol is meaningless

 COLOMBIA said the ability to display flexibility had just about run out among non-Annex I countries

 UKRAINE defended retaining Articles 6, 7 and 8 because they define the mechanisms for implementation

 RUSSIA supported a proposal from the Chair to close discussion, and suggested a protocol between the EU and G-77/CHINA

 UGANDA said there would be no "free" trading of emissions

 Developing country Parties had reportedly lost patience with industrialized countries determined to bring home a final package without consulting their "significant others" from the G-77/CHINA, now represented on the extended Bureau

<p> For the G-77/CHINA, Bakari Mbonde (Tanzania) said decisive action would be needed to strengthen developed country obligations

<p> Many speakers, such as IRAN, INDIA, BANGLADESH, VENEZUELA, KOREA, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, MALDIVES, CHINA, PARAGUAY, SEYCHELLES and BARBADOS on behalf of Caribbean Community, opposed any new commitments for developing countries since developed nations had not met their existing commitments

 In the 9 December COW, BURKINA FASO, supported by BANGLADESH and UGANDA, called for a reference to an FCCC provision on taking full account of the situations of the least developed countries

 On aggregating emissions of Annex I Parties (paragraph 1), RUSSIA noted that its previously introduced quantitative indicators for limitation of GHG emissions were omitted from Annex B and stated that the Russian target should say 100% of the 1990 base level

 UKRAINE also specified 100% for itself

<p>On a paragraph on deciding the modalities, rules, and guidelines for estimating changes in carbon stocks (paragraph 4), JAPAN proposed adding a sentence specifying that decisions should apply in the second and subsequent commitment periods "unless otherwise decided by the COP serving as the MOP

 The paragraph was later reopened by AUSTRALIA, supported by the PHILIPPINES, who proposed adding "A Party may choose to apply such a decision on categories its first commitment period, provided that these activities are since 1990

<p>On calculations of QELROs for each Annex I Party (paragraph 7), AUSTRALIA noted a previously submitted amendment that "Parties in Annex B for whom land use change and forestry constituted a net source of GHG emissions in 1990 shall include in their 1990 emissions base the aggregate anthropogenic CO2 equivalent emissions minus removals in 1990 from land use change" in calculating their assigned amount

" ICELAND stated that actions taken before 1990 make its 110% target unattainable

<p>SWITZERLAND, supported by HUNGARY, urged SBSTA to further elaborate on the inclusion of bunker fuel emissions in overall GHG inventories

 JAPAN, opposed by the UK, said there were "actual" and "potential" methods of estimating emissions and proposed a new paragraph under which the COP would affirm the "actual" method for including HFC, PFC and SF6 emissions in QELROs

<p>The G-77/CHINA said there was no consensus on Alternative A, which contained a list of programmes and measures for mitigation and adaptation, and proposed deleting it and Alternative B, which emphasized technology transfer

 The PHILIPPINES, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, proposed deletion of the text in brackets

<p>The PHILIPPINES, supported by the MARSHALL ISLANDS, FRANCE, UGANDA, SAUDI ARABIA, TRINIDAD and TOBAGO, the EU and the NETHERLANDS, proposed deletion of a paragraph stating that certified emissions reductions from 2000 to the beginning of the first commitment period can be used to achieve compliance during that commitment period

 FRANCE said COP-4 should consider the paragraph

 RUSSIA, COSTA RICA, HUNGARY, the US, CROATIA, JAPAN, PERU and POLAND opposed the deletion, as did CANADA, who said joint implementation with credit was an important notion to retain

 It began COP-3 negotiations as Article 6 of the negotiating text produced by AGBM-8 (FCCC/CP/1997/2), having been bracketed by the G-77/CHINA

 CANADA introduced an alternative text, stating that commitments under Article 3 would be met in a "cost effective manner" and "in accordance with international rules

<p>INDIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, and supported by CHINA and INDONESIA, reiterated its objection to the concept of emissions trading, stating that it is extraneous to the Berlin Mandate and would not lead to GHG emissions limitation and reduction

 CHINA, supported by INDIA, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN, TOGO, UGANDA, NIGERIA, VIETNAM and the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, proposed deleting the paragraph on emissions trading, along with two subsequent paragraphs on including and subtracting emissions reduction units acquired and transferred, respectively, in each Party's assigned amount (paragraphs 3

 INDIA stressed that trading should be based on equitably allocated entitlements

<p>MEXICO, RUSSIA, ISRAEL, UKRAINE, NAURU, AUSTRALIA, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, ROMANIA, JAPAN, ARGENTINA, SAMOA, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND and SWITZERLAND favored keeping the three paragraphs as drafted

 IRAN suggested that the Secretariat study the concept for future action

 UGANDA, supported by NIGERIA, specified that future COPs should examines the merits of trading

<p>The UK, supported by HUNGARY, TUVALU, GRENADA, SEYCHELLES, ZIMBABWE, the CZECH REPUBLIC, CHILE, URUGUAY, the PHILIPPINES, SLOVENIA, AOSIS, ZAMBIA and COLOMBIA, proposed amending the paragraph to clarify that trading would not be allowed until appropriate rules and guidelines were agreed by the COP

<p>The US stressed its change in position to support for very deep reductions and, with CANADA, ARGENTINA and NEW ZEALAND, proposed that COP-4 define relevant rules and guidelines

 The GAMBIA, MALAWI, KIRIBATI, SAUDI ARABIA, ZAMBIA and IRAN supported deletion of paragraphs 3

 This was supported by KENYA and COSTA RICA

<p>A number of countries, including the EU, GAMBIA, JAPAN, SWEDEN, SYRIA, CROATIA, NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, EGYPT, NEPAL SPAIN, GHANA and the G-77/CHINA, stressed that: active leadership to prevent global warming must come from developed country Parties; domestic action must provide the main means for meeting commitments to combat climate change; and noted that flexibility mechanisms were supplemental and their use must be subject to strict rules of accountability and compliance

<p>The UK, with GHANA, said scientific uncertainty should not be used as an excuse for inaction

<p>GHANA said the challenges of climate change mitigation and adaptation present an additional burden to developing countries and with the CARICOM states, ICELAND, AUSTRALIA, the US, SAUDI ARABIA, NEW ZEALAND and the G-77/CHINA called for elaboration of mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol

<p>Several Parties including DENMARK, VENEZUELA, POLAND, AUSTRALIA, FRANCE, the EU and the US called for the establishment of a coherent, effective and strong compliance system

 MAURITANIA noted that no objections were raised to the proposed agenda changes during informal consultations on 1 November

 SAUDI ARABIA, supported by VENEZUELA, accepted the proposal, but stressed that discussion under Item 5 (matters related to the Kyoto Protocol) should allow time for Articles 2

 Delegates observed a moment of silence for the recent tragedies at the request of INDONESIA, on behalf of the G-77/China

 ARGENTINA recalled its request to include this item on the agenda and noted that no consensus had emerged despite its efforts to encourage consultations

 INDIA recalled that the debate at Kyoto rejected the idea of voluntary commitments, stating it was not implied in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities

 SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, VENEZUELA and ALGERIA cautioned that discussion of the issue at this stage would be divisive and distract from discussions of compliance and continuing increases in developed countries' emissions

 QATAR, TOGO, CUBA, THAILAND and UGANDA supported the G-77/China

<p>ZIMBABWE, TANZANIA and SOUTH AFRICA said methodological and institutional issues relating to the flexibility mechanisms, such as the CDM, should be the focus of deliberation

 CHILE said several developing countries were making serious efforts to limit GHG emissions and favored an exchange of views on voluntary cooperation, without entailing binding obligations or ignoring the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities

 With JAPAN, she said that non-Annex I Parties wishing to adopt voluntary commitments must be given an opportunity to consider their options under the Kyoto Protocol

 NORWAY said the workshop revealed that credits for carbon sinks under Protocol Article 3

<p>Impact of single projects on emissions: On Tuesday, 3 November, ICELAND submitted a draft decision that provides for process emissions from a single project, coming into operation after 1990 and contributing more than 5%, in the first commitment period, to the total greenhouse gas emissions of an Annex B Party, to be reported separately and not be included in the national total

 ICELAND said this was necessary in small economies because of the high proportional impact of single projects

<p>The MARSHALL ISLANDS, supported by BRAZIL, BARBADOS and TUVALU, said the draft decision would lead to special dispensations prior to the Kyoto Protocol's entry into force and could create an incentive for emissions increases in Annex I countries

 AUSTRALIA recognized the impact of single projects on small economies and supported establishing guidelines and methodologies to specify circumstances under which single projects could be accommodated

 ICELAND noted that this issue was identified at COP-3 and it was raised now to facilitate ratification of the Protocol

 ICELAND stressed that only projects with demonstrable global benefit would fall under the draft decision, if they could not be accommodated within the Party's assigned amount

 NORWAY sought continual re-evaluation of inventory data, including base years, as methodologies improve

 The US, with AUSTRALIA, said there should be coordination between international environmental agreements, but the process required careful consideration given the possible implications for industry

 BRAZIL described it as the allocation of responsibilities among different emitters based on their actions as measured by the increase in global temperatures, rather than by emissions

 The G-77/CHINA said without practical technical know-how, technology transfer would be impossible

 With GRENADA and the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, CHINA emphasized the role of national governments and international organizations and said technology transfer should be on non- commercial and preferential terms

 The REPUBLIC OF KOREA and CANADA supported work on inventories for sources of new technologies and gap identification

 The G-77/CHINA favored retaining reference to a TTM

 The PHILIPPINES suggested that a body was needed to operationalize the process, adding that experts involved in the consultative process should be from the FCCC roster of experts

 With AUSTRALIA, they said the issue should be considered in a non-political manner

 PAKISTAN requested Parties to delete Turkey from Annexes I and II

 TURKEY reiterated that its current status as was an anomaly that delays its ratification of the Convention

<p>NORWAY, with the EU, AUSTRALIA, the US and CANADA, stated that: the national communications and their reviews were important to the Convention process; reporting issues and guidelines required increased attention; and the Secretariat should conduct more analytical work

 The PHILIPPINES highlighted the need for capacity building and financing, which should follow the guidelines for initial communications in Decision 10/CP

 CHINA, supported by TOGO and the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, said the decision recognized the need for adequate and additional financial resources for inventories, an enormous task for some developing countries

 URUGUAY and the REPUBLIC OF KOREA described their initial communications and national efforts underway to limit GHGs

 The G-77/CHINA, after considering comments to their initial proposal presented in the previous meeting, outlined two new proposals on the substantive issues, namely, the status of and guidance to the GEF

 The G-77/CHINA said this proposal did not adequately meet the needs of developing country Parties

 The G-77/CHINA said: the issue is important to the Convention; a clear decision defining new commitments should be reached; and developed countries were shirking their responsibilities in this matter

 Developing country Parties insisted that a G-77/CHINA draft decision provide the basis for the deliberations

 A discussion of four draft proposals, presented by AUSTRALIA, the EU, the G-77/CHINA and the US, dominated the deliberations

 Debate concerned procedural issues on how to address the texts, with the G-77/CHINA indicating reluctance to consider a compilation text prepared by the Co-Chairs

<p>Schedule of meetings for 2000-2001: On Tuesday, 3 November, in the SBI plenary, the EU, supported by CANADA and AUSTRALIA, proposed that COP-5 be held in 2000 rather than 1999

 CHINA noted that several issues under the Convention remained unresolved and time was needed to prepare for the Protocol's entry into force

 The EU, SWITZERLAND and SLOVENIA said COP- 4 should agree on as many principles as possible and adopt detailed schedules to implement the Kyoto Protocol

<p>With CANADA, the US and NORWAY, JAPAN underscored the importance of addressing the flexibility mechanisms in parallel, reaching early agreement and developing a work plan for unresolved issues

 Supported by CANADA and the US, he opposed quantitative ceilings for reductions achieved through the flexibility mechanisms, noting that there was no ceiling on transfers of assigned amounts under Protocol Article 4 ("bubble")

 Other Parties, including the G-77/CHINA, called for more time to consider the volume of documentation

<p>On Friday, 6 November, the G-77/CHINA stressed the need for a clear section in the work programme devoted to the nature and scope of the mechanisms to facilitate comparison

 HONDURAS, supported by several Latin American countries, called for expeditious creation of the CDM, and proposed an "interim phase approach" to develop guidelines and rules

 SWITZERLAND provided the Co-Chairs with a two-page work programme

<p>On Monday, 9 November, the G-77/CHINA submitted a proposed work programme containing an extensive list of issues, embodying a "step-by-step" approach and prioritizing the CDM

 AUSTRALIA said the issues settled at Kyoto should not be re-opened

<p>On Tuesday, 10 November, draft work programmes were submitted by AUSTRALIA (on behalf of CANADA, ICELAND, NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and the US), JAPAN, SWITZERLAND and the Co-Chairs

 SAUDI ARABIA, with QATAR, said it would support the Co-Chairs' amended text, if FCCC Articles 4

 AUSTRALIA and other Annex I Parties, as well as the EU, put forward the documents they had produced for the contact group

 The G-77/CHINA urged discussion of the contact group Co-Chairs' draft, with CHINA opposing the use of other documents

 With the US, EU, CANADA, JAPAN, KUWAIT and AUSTRALIA, the AFRICAN GROUP favored bracketing the new Co-Chairs' draft entirely

 VENEZUELA said forwarding the Co-Chairs' text would require formulation of a joint subsidiary bodies' position

 KUWAIT suggested the draft decision of the SBSTA/SBI Co-Chairs be forwarded to the COP as a Chair's text

<p>SWITZERLAND, with NORWAY, JAPAN, SLOVENIA, the EU, the US, AUSTRALIA and COLOMBIA, contended that the AIJ pilot phase provides lessons for the flexibility mechanisms

 POLAND observed that a review of the process could explain why some countries were excluded and resolve some of the concerns of the G-77/CHINA

 VENEZUELA, BANGLADESH, the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, IRAN, SYRIA, KUWAIT, LEBANON, NIGERIA, THE GAMBIA, ECUADOR, ALGERIA, MOROCCO and INDONESIA supported SAUDI ARABIA

 CANADA called for a balance between the Convention and the Protocol and said Protocol issues needed attention to expedite ratification

 The US, JAPAN and AUSTRALIA said Decision 3/CP

 BOLIVIA stressed that substantive participation of non-Annex I Parties should be based on the principle of sovereignty and right to self-determination and that their emissions limits cannot constitute a precedent nor commit others to emissions limitation targets

<p>The US, THAILAND, PERU and TUVALU announced their signature to the Kyoto Protocol

<p>A number of speakers, including the EU, THE GAMBIA, JAPAN, SWEDEN, SYRIA, CROATIA, NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, EGYPT, NEPAL, SPAIN, GHANA and the G-77/CHINA, stressed that: active leadership to prevent global warming must come from developed country Parties; domestic action must provide the main means for meeting commitments to combat climate change; and flexibility mechanisms were supplemental and their use must be subject to strict rules of accountability and compliance

<p>GHANA said the challenges of climate change mitigation and adaptation present an additional burden to developing countries and with the CARICOM States, ICELAND, AUSTRALIA, the US, SAUDI ARABIA, NEW ZEALAND and the G-77/CHINA, called for elaboration of mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol

<p>The SEYCHELLES expressed concern that vulnerable nations that are insignificant on the global stage may be excluded from programmes such as those under the flexibility mechanisms

 THAILAND supported North-South and South-South partnerships based on equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibility

 BRAZIL underscored the CDM as a means of inducing new and mostly private investment, and suggested that it be project-based and include all countries

 VENEZUELA said CDM projects must ensure net contribution to sustainable development in the host country, avoid hidden costs, and use project-based rather than sectoral or national baselines to avoid future imposition of targets

 MEXICO stressed open criteria and a progressive approach to the CDM that could foster immediate and simple actions without artificial limits, not contained in the Protocol

<p>Several Parties, including DENMARK, VENEZUELA, POLAND, AUSTRALIA, FRANCE, the EU and the US, called for the establishment of a coherent, effective and strong compliance system

 BRAZIL and KENYA called for further discussions on the adverse impacts of climate change

 Supported by MEXICO, BHUTAN and ICELAND, COLOMBIA called attention to sinks under the Protocol and underscored the elaboration of methodologies

 NEPAL stressed regional environmental cooperation and opposed undue limits on energy consumption

 NICARAGUA thanked the Parties for their support and noted that the region will require continued support

 ICELAND supported this proposal

 <p>SAUDI ARABIA, supported by CHINA and INDIA, said some issues may not be adequately dealt with and suggested SBSTA and SBI jointly address common agenda items

 CHINA expressed concern over the possible closure of the activities implemented jointly (AIJ) pilot phase and smooth transition to project implemented under Protocol Articles 6 (joint implementation) and 12 (CDM), stating that current experience is inadequate

 Several delegates, including AUSTRALIA, the EU, and JAPAN, called for steps to resolve IPCC’s funding problems

 SAUDI ARABIA and SWITZERLAND called for the scope of future efforts to be widened beyond the Protocol mechanisms

 The GAMBIA, the MARSHALL ISLANDS, and ZIMBABWE emphasized the importance of capacity building, particularly for non-Annex I Parties

 TANZANIA and ZIMBABWE called for elaboration of what capacity building means and said the focus should be on strengthening national capacities

 <p>The PHILIPPINES, supported by CHINA, objected to wording in the agenda item on non-Annex I communications referring to the “process” for considering national communications, suggesting instead “matters related to the consideration of non-Annex I communications

” CHINA, with the PHILIPPINES and the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, said the item on the timing of second non-Annex I communications was premature, as only 11 developing countries had submitted first national communications

 SAUDI ARABIA, supported by BOTSWANA, said the implementation of FCCC Articles 4

 <p>On the consideration of non-Annex I Parties’ communications, the PHILIPPINES questioned the purpose of this agenda item, as the Convention calls for consideration of national communications by all Parties

 AUSTRALIA supported revision of guidelines for non-Annex I communications and said it should conclude before the lodgement date of second national communications

 <p>On provision of financial and technical support for the preparation of non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA inquired about the non-inclusion of an agenda item on the financial mechanism and said timing of second national communications for non-Annex I countries was subject to availability of financial resources

 JAPAN expected the GEF to be utilized effectively but would consider other means to enhance developing country capacity building to accelerate the preparation of national communications

 TOGO emphasized the need to involve local experts

 BRAZIL stressed the need to involve all the relevant sectors creating national inventories as it would generate awareness and contribute to more credible numbers

 The G-77/CHINA requested more information on the review process

<p>SAUDI ARABIA, supported by CHINA and INDIA, said some issues may not be adequately dealt with and suggested SBSTA and SBI jointly address common agenda items

<p>The PHILIPPINES, supported by CHINA, objected to wording in the agenda item on non-Annex I communications referring to the “process” for considering national communications, suggesting instead “matters related to the consideration of non-Annex I communications

 <p> JOINT SBI/SBSTA SESSION <p>On compliance under the Protocol, the G-77/CHINA said Annex I Parties’ communications should include information on Convention implementation, particularly: policies and measures to modify longer term trends; new and additional finance; assistance to meet adaptation costs; technology transfer; and capacity building of developing countries

 <p>On AIJ under the pilot phase, the G-77/CHINA and others expressed concern at the lack of regional balance in projects

 The AFRICAN GROUP and NORWAY called for capacity building to remedy this, particularly in Africa

 SWITZERLAND called for development of terms of reference for the review of the pilot phase for consideration by COP-5

 The US, with JAPAN and GUATEMALA, said experiences gained from AIJ projects could provide valuable lessons for Protocol mechanism development

 GUATEMALA, with BRAZIL, supported AIJ project eligibility for CDM certification, if the project meets the necessary criteria and, with RUSSIA, called for straightforward guidelines for the certification system

 As AIJ does not include a credit element and lacks adequate reference to sustainable development, IRAN opposed linking it with CDM

 <p>On the Protocol mechanisms, the G-77/CHINA stressed the need to, inter alia: begin with formulating principles to guide the methodological and operational process; establish a common understanding of the mechanisms; and ensure that the nature and scope of mechanisms do not perpetuate North-South inequities

 <p>On the Protocol mechanisms, CHINA said the synthesis of proposals on emissions trading contained several extraneous elements, such as competitiveness and market size, and called for a revised synthesis

 The US, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, NORWAY, NEW ZEALAND and CANADA opposed the EU proposal to place caps on the use of the Protocol mechanisms

 SWITZERLAND proposed a post-verification system for emissions trading that allows Parties to trade only the excess of assigned amount units

 Supported by KAZAKHSTAN, he proposed that JI begin prior to 2008

 AOSIS said that actions under the mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic action and, with SENEGAL, indicated that the mechanisms be guided by equity and transparency principles

 <p>On capacity building, SWITZERLAND called for an overview of past and ongoing initiatives on AIJ and the mechanisms

 <p> SBSTA <p>On research and systematic observation, SWITZERLAND and the AFRICAN GROUP urged implementation of COP-4’s recommendations

 CANADA, with the EU and RUSSIA, urged support for the Global Climate Observatory System (GCOS)

 AUSTRALIA called for separate development of guidelines for national communications inventory data

 NORWAY said more experience on the use of guidelines was necessary before a final decision is taken

 The EU and JAPAN supported a common reporting format proposed for inventory data guidelines

 CANADA stressed substance, not timing, as the most important consideration and, with POLAND, said it is impractical for and beyond the means of Parties to report on all climate change related policies and measures

 RUSSIA opposed Canada’s suggestion for an annual system of providing inventories, as it would be costly and difficult

 POLAND noted that if Parties decide to change inventory methodology, artificial reduction of emissions may occur, and proposed recalculating emissions whenever the COP adopts new or amended emission inventory methodology

 CANADA underscored the importance of developing realistic review guidelines and, with the US, called for a more streamlined approach

 AUSTRALIA emphasized defining realistic objectives for COP-6 and maintaining a clear sense of the different requirements of the Convention and the Protocol

 ICELAND called for care when implementing the Protocol to minimize disruption to existing climate change policies

 BOTSWANA, ZIMBABWE and the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC said national communications should be an ongoing process and noted that practical difficulties faced by non-Annex I Parties impede the necessary continuity

 URUGUAY expressed satisfaction with the GEF’s assistance

 MEXICO highlighted the need to share experiences at the regional level to build capacities for national communications

 Chair Kante suggested continued discussion in a contact group and a meeting between the G-77/CHINA, the GEF and implementing agencies to exchange views on the difficulties encountered in providing financial resources for non-Annex I communications

 Several Parties, including EGYPT, the EU, JAPAN, POLAND and RUSSIA favored establishing a COW as it would benefit small delegations

 Stating that COP-5 will be largely a technical meeting, SAUDI ARABIA, with KAZAKHSTAN and CHINA, opposed the creation of a COW

 CANADA and SLOVENIA preferred the High Level Segment but without formal oral presentations

 SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA cautioned against introducing controversial issues that could “torpedo” the success of COP-5

 The NETHERLANDS expressed interest in hosting COP-6

<p> JOINT SBI/SBSTA SESSION <p>On compliance under the Protocol, the G-77/CHINA said Annex I Parties’ communications should include information on Convention implementation, particularly: policies and measures to modify longer term trends; new and additional finance; assistance to meet adaptation costs; technology transfer; and capacity building of developing countries

<p>On LULUCF, NORWAY said SBSTA-10 can make progress on policy and procedural issues and guide IPCC with its preparation of a Special Report on LULUCF

 AUSTRALIA called for focus on key policy and procedural issues relevant to the negotiating process, and for clarification of the Protocol’s reference to establishing 1990 carbon stock levels

 NIGERIA said the Special Report should include definitions of baselines for carbon stocks in sinks and should ensure that policy options are consistent with other convention requirements

 SAUDI ARABIA, SWITZERLAND, GREENPEACE and others expressed reservations about the proposed timing for deliberation on some issues, noting the relevance of the Special Report

 SWITZERLAND stressed the need to introduce more stringent regulations, improve air traffic management nationally and internationally and use economic instruments such as eliminating tax privileges on aviation fuel

<p>On allocation of bunker emissions, AUSTRALIA highlighted the need to establish a policy framework and adopt the most suitable method of recording emissions

 Stating that this is a complicated process, JAPAN called on ICAO and IMO to provide necessary information to help identify possible solutions

 TANZANIA suggested establishing FCCC collaborating centers in developing countries for information purposes and capacity building

 UGANDA supported regional capacity building and South-South sharing of expertise

<p>On other matters, BRAZIL reported on a recent workshop held to consider its proposal on determining responsibility based on historical emissions

 Chair Kante initially sought to confine discussion to consultations to be led by Mohamed Mahmoud Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania) but at the insistence of CHINA, the PHILIPPINES, SAUDI ARABIA and INDIA, allowed Parties to make general statements in Plenary

 The PHILIPPINES stressed that capacity building was for developing countries not for the Secretariat

 IRAN, with CHINA, BRAZIL, SAUDI ARABIA, INDIA and the PHILIPPINES expressed concern over a steep increase in the proposed budget’s expenditure levels

 The PHILIPPINES noted that developing countries were penalized for arrears in their contributions by being denied the benefit of the trust fund for participation and inquired whether similar penalties existed for Annex I countries

 SWITZERLAND asked why there were unspent reserves

 JAPAN said it preferred repayment to the Parties

 The G-77/CHINA accepted the document

<p>On reporting on technology transfer and financial assistance, CANADA, with the US, said exhaustive reporting on all areas related to climate change, including reporting on private and public technology transfer, is impractical and beyond the means of most Parties’ budgets

<p>On the proposed agenda, the G-77/CHINA called for a discussion on the basic principles for a compliance regime

 She noted a lack of submissions received from developing countries and, with KENYA, supported compiling views through a questionnaire

 CHINA supported including a section on basic principles, particularly on common but differentiated responsibilities

 With SWITZERLAND, he called for a draft negotiating text by COP-5

 CANADA said the first task is stocktaking of the compliance-related elements and, with NEW ZEALAND and the US, underscored the importance of tracking other groups’ work

 JAPAN highlighted the importance of examining other multilateral environmental agreements

 RUSSIA called for a well-defined legal interpretation of compliance

 CHINA proposed including a reference to "principles" in the agenda

<p>On identification of compliance-related elements and gaps, the US, with CANADA and the EU, indicated the need to differentiate elements from gaps and proposed three categories to identify them: substantive rules; procedures for addressing compliance; and consequences of non-compliance

 JAPAN noted that although expert review teams were useful in assessing implementation, determining non-compliance was not within their mandate

 AUSTRALIA and other delegations noted the need for continuous feedback between the JWG and other contact groups to avoid overlap and contradictions on substantive rules

 The G-77/CHINA stated that, although it has often been a proponent of strong and steady growth in Conventions’ budgets, it cannot support the extent of the proposed increase, and noted the current trend among many Parties to support zero-growth budgets

 The EU, supported by the US, CANADA and RUSSIA, suggested that the Secretariat could prepare several other options for a draft budget

 The US and CANADA preferred resolving the issue at this session, given COP-5’s heavy workload

 CANADA emphasized that the Secretariat should focus on its facilitative function

 IRAN suggested that the Secretariat provide at least two reports on biennium budgets, thus allowing later drafts to take into account additional expenses resulting from COP decisions

 The PHILIPPINES noted that a budget increase does not necessarily benefit the Parties

 <p>In reference to certain programme activities outlined in the budget, CHINA stated that the Secretariat was not mandated to provide policy guidance to Parties but rather the other way around

 EGYPT pointed to streamlining FCCC programme activities with those undertaken in other fora as a means to reduce expenditures

 INDIA inquired about the Secretariat’s policies on gratis personnel and suggested that the Secretariat prepare a table comparing the proposed budget to previous ones

 <p>On contingencies for conference services, the G-77/CHINA said the UN General Assembly (UNGA) should be asked to include the FCCC’s requirements in its budget

 On regional workshops to be organized by the Secretariat, JAPAN announced that it would give US$100,000 for the Asia and Pacific workshop

 <p>The G-77/CHINA, with NIGERIA and CHINA, underscored the importance of technology transfer to developing countries

 CHINA cautioned against redefining technology transfer and stressed that transfer under the Convention should occur on non-commercial terms

<p>In reference to certain programme activities outlined in the budget, CHINA stated that the Secretariat was not mandated to provide policy guidance to Parties but rather the other way around

<p>On contingencies for conference services, the G-77/CHINA said the UN General Assembly (UNGA) should be asked to include the FCCC’s requirements in its budget

<p>The G-77/CHINA, with NIGERIA and CHINA, underscored the importance of technology transfer to developing countries

 EGYPT stressed the need to make publicly owned technology available to developing countries and expressed concern about the limited attention given to adaptation technologies

 AUSTRALIA stressed the importance of country specific market- based approaches, the private sector and the role of the clean development mechanism (CDM) in facilitating technology transfer

 The US, NETHERLANDS, GERMANY, FRANCE and AUSTRALIA announced financial contributions to support the consultative process

 The G-77/CHINA, supported by KIRIBATI, MAURITIUS, PHILIPPINES and CAMEROON, suggested the creation of a permanent mechanism to facilitate technology transfer

 The PHILIPPINES, with CAMEROON, said technology transfer should be tackled as a commitment not as a commercial undertaking

 MAURITIUS noted the urgent need to identify specific regional requirements

 SLOVENIA underscored the need for capacity building, as well as incentives to the owners of technology to deliver them to the developing countries

 THAILAND expressed his support for the consultative process and offered to host a regional workshop

 CAMEROON stressed the importance of training to enable developing countries to benefit from technology transfer

 The G-77/CHINA reserved its right to introduce substantive issues should other Parties do the same

 The US also emphasized the importance of transparency and, with JAPAN, called for reasonable certainty about consequences for non- compliance

 AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the US called for a regime tailored to the Kyoto Protocol, as it differs from other multilateral environmental agreements

 JAPAN said the system may need a short grace period at the end of commitment period

 IRAN noted that Protocol Article 18 (non-compliance) does not specify any particular articles, but applies to the entire Protocol

 The G-77/CHINA said it was working on a position and unable to participate

 AOSIS cautioned against attempting to differentiate legally binding from non-legally binding obligations, and IRAN underscored the legally binding character of the Protocol as a whole

 CHINA said Article 18 applies to all obligations of the Protocol

 AUSTRALIA said a distinction between binding and non- binding aspects would be necessary for practical reasons

 AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, opposed by the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, stressed the usefulness of peer reviews, rather than a punitive regime, to enforce obligations

 The EU, supported by JAPAN and AOSIS, noted its preference for a system that combines “hard” and “soft” enforcement measures that are graded according to the gravity of the breach and the nature of the obligation

 CANADA referred to procedural steps leading to the application of consequences as an integral part of the compliance system

 The G-77/CHINA said that it was still in the process of synthesizing national positions and requested time to deliberate later that evening

 The G-77/CHINA tabled a draft decision on initial and subsequent national communications from non-Annex I Parties to be considered for adoption at COP-5

 <p>The PHILIPPINES underscored the need for continuity of work on non-Annex I Party communications, inquired about the extent of compliance to IPCC guidelines and noted the need to identify Parties’ technical and financial constraints

<p>The PHILIPPINES underscored the need for continuity of work on non-Annex I Party communications, inquired about the extent of compliance to IPCC guidelines and noted the need to identify Parties’ technical and financial constraints

<p> JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE <p> The G-77/CHINA identified elements relevant to procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance under the Kyoto Protocol

 <p> The G-77/CHINA also stated that only Parties that are in compliance with their obligations and are bound by a compliance regime should be allowed to participate in the Protocol mechanisms

 The G-77/CHINA also circulated a list of questions on a compliance system, including: what should be the principles that guide the development of procedures to implement Article 18 (non-compliance) of the Protocol and what procedures and mechanisms under Article 18 entail binding consequences

 <p> JAPAN, the US and AUSTRALIA said the proposal would form a useful basis for beginning a dialogue, and expressed their intention to raise questions at the working group's next meeting

 <p> AUSTRALIA noted that the group's consideration of the charts had clarified issues and would help advance negotiations

 With CANADA and NEW ZEALAND, he suggested incorporating these new ideas into revised draft conclusions

 The G-77/CHINA expressed concern at the charts, which look beyond COP-5, and said the Secretariat should not be instructed to incorporate ideas from the charts into the draft guidelines

 The PHILIPPINES said enabling activities went beyond capacity building and highlighted the importance of identifying difficulties faced by non-Annex I countries such as the lack of financial resources and technology to, inter alia, gather data for national communications

 UGANDA and LAOS pointed to the need for capacity building on GEF procedures, including for the implementing agencies in the field

 GEORGIA suggested that CDM activities be a component of second non-Annex I communications and called for capacity building to achieve this

 UGANDA, with CHINA and ARGENTINA, indicated that national communications were a continuous process and emphasized the need for ongoing assistance for data collection

 BARBADOS referred to vulnerability as one of the main components of non-Annex I communications and pointed to difficulties in obtaining financial assistance

 MEXICO noted its satisfaction with UNDP regional workshops on communications

 TOGO called for workshops tailored to the specific needs and circumstances of individual countries

 ARGENTINA emphasized that experts' qualifications are essential to the workshops' success

 ARGENTINA asked for information on workshops in Latin America

 The PHILIPPINES sought clarification on the meaning of "timeliness" of non-Annex I Parties' communications as an objective

 BARBADOS pointed to difficulties in attending the workshops given that no financial assistance for participation was provided

<p> The G-77/CHINA identified elements relevant to procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance under the Kyoto Protocol

<p> The G-77/CHINA also stated that only Parties that are in compliance with their obligations and are bound by a compliance regime should be allowed to participate in the Protocol mechanisms

<p> AUSTRALIA noted that the group's consideration of the charts had clarified issues and would help advance negotiations

 <p>The G-77/CHINA tabled a draft decision on arrangements for COP-5

 CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, QATAR and KUWAIT, inquired about the meaning of “long-term implementation of the Convention” as a discussion topic and said the high-level segment should focus on reviewing the state of implementation of the BAPA

 JAPAN accepted most of the G-77/CHINA’s suggestions, except on timing for the high-level segment

 <p>The NETHERLANDS announced its offer to host COP-6 in the Hague and said it was up to Parties to decide whether it should take place in 2000 or 2001

 AUSTRALIA said that since COP-6 had important decisions to take it should be held early in 2001

 CANADA noted the importance of setting the technical foundation of decisions on issues such as technology transfer, the mechanisms and compliance

The G-77/CHINA preferred scheduling COP-6 in October or November 2000, and objected to additional intersessional meetings of the subsidiary bodies

 KUWAIT and LEBANON stressed that the COPs should be held on a yearly basis

 <p><i>Joint contact group on mechanisms:</i> The G-77/CHINA requested more time to formulate its position

 NORWAY, on behalf of the Umbrella Group (a fluid grouping of non-EU Annex I countries), expressed regret that G-77/China was not prepared

 The G-77/CHINA pointed to inconsistencies between the draft decision and previous COP decisions on providing guidance to the operating entity of the financial mechanism

 TOGO noted that it was premature to think about guidelines for second communications as most non- Annex I countries were still preparing their first

 MEXICO said financial support should be available not only for vulnerability assessment but also for mitigation and adaptation efforts

 SWITZERLAND emphasized the need to identify problems with the preparation of inventories

<p>The G-77/CHINA tabled a draft decision on arrangements for COP-5

<p>The NETHERLANDS announced its offer to host COP-6 in the Hague and said it was up to Parties to decide whether it should take place in 2000 or 2001

<p><i>Joint contact group on mechanisms:</i> The G-77/CHINA requested more time to formulate its position

 CHINA, supported by the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, said important decisions sometimes have to be reiterated until they are implemented

 SWITZERLAND proposed including a reference to Decision 8/CP

<p>On the nature and timing of the proposed informal exchange of information, the G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA and IRAN, preferred holding it after COP-5, but before the twelfth sessions of the subsidiary bodies (SB-12)

 SWITZERLAND suggested the co-chairs develop terms of reference for the informal discussions

 The EU, CANADA, the US and AUSTRALIA supported holding it prior to COP-5 in order to better prepare for and participate more fully in that meeting

 AUSTRALIA noted that the Protocol is breaking new ground in international law and recommended examining other compliance models

 CANADA said the discussions would allow more effective use of scarce time and resources and, with the EU, said it would provide an opportunity for "mutual learning

<p>Joint Contact Group on Mechanisms: The G-77/CHINA introduced its position paper on the clean development mechanism (CDM), highlighting the CDM’s role in assisting developing countries in achieving sustainable development and developed countries in complying with their QELROs

 The G-77/CHINA recommended that its paper be the basis for future negotiations

 CHINA identified issues missing from the Secretariat’s synthesis report but covered in the G-77/China paper, including transparency and climate change effectiveness

 PERU recommended a common baseline for joint implementation and the CDM

 NORWAY, supported by CANADA, said operational entities were a key element for CDM institutional structure

 The G-77/CHINA said project eligibility is central to the principle, nature and scope of the CDM

 NORWAY noted that there was no section on baselines in the synthesis report

<p>Regarding the contribution to sustainable development, the G-77/CHINA said the recipient country should be the sole judge of whether a project meets its sustainable development priorities

 NORWAY proposed that this be determined under project registration

 CHINA suggested applying a similar condition to the funding country to confirm how a CDM would result in certified emissions reductions (CERs)

<p>On sequestration, CANADA, supported by NORWAY and IRAN, proposed addressing this under project eligibility

 The G-77/CHINA said discussions on sequestration should be avoided until ongoing studies by SBSTA and IPCC are concluded

 On technology transfer and project financing, the G-77/CHINA highlighted the dimension of additionality, a feature absent in the Chair’s draft

<p>On supplementarity, the G-77/CHINA highlighted the primacy of domestic action and recommended the development of guidelines on supplementarity

 On levies, the G-77/CHINA highlighted establishing an adaptation fund

 On CERs, the G-77/CHINA suggested discussing them bearing in mind the purposes of the CDM

 On further work on CDM, the G-77/CHINA stressed addressing principles and basic elements that are currently not featured in the synthesis report

<p>The G-77/CHINA underscored the significance of capacity building

 Supported by PERU, he said capacity building should be incorporated into all CDM projects to enhance endogenous expertise to identify technology needs and capacities for assimilation of technology

 The PHILIPPINES stressed that capacity-building initiatives should be country-driven and within the intergovernmental process

 CHINA said capacity building should be "of, for and in" the developing country

 SENEGAL suggested involving the financial sector, sensitizing the public and decision-makers and training developing country officials

 SWITZERLAND noted the bottom-up approach suggested by the G-77/China and advocated tailor-made approaches for each country

 VENEZUELA stressed the need to establish clear rules for transparency regarding the project’s contribution to sustainability and the costs, risks and liabilities in the developing country

 On the structure, purpose and principles, the G-77/CHINA noted its submission on elements that should be addressed to enable the COP/MOP to elaborate guidelines

 CHINA suggested focusing on cluster issues, including: principles, purpose, nature and scope; methodological issues; and institutional issues

 SWITZERLAND inquired about a date for early crediting noting the lack of clarity in the case of joint implementation (JI)

 JAPAN noted areas of convergence in the proposals submitted on environmental and cost effectiveness, equity and transparency

 JAPAN stated that the term "operational entities" was unique to CDM and could not be used when discussing JI

 JAPAN preferred addressing initiation of JI projects along with project eligibility and said many countries did not concur with the two-step approach

 The G-77/CHINA reiterated the need address principles and basic elements before dealing with methodological and operational issues

 The PHILIPPINES distinguished emissions trading from other mechanisms and stressed that it did not imply a right to pollute but an obligation to reduce greenhouse gases

 The EU identified divergence on interchangeability between CERs and ERUs, and, with JAPAN, noted convergence on cost effectiveness, environmental benefits, equity and transparency

 With the G-77/CHINA and the US, the EU said the Protocol did not create property rights, and stated that emissions trading was a way of fulfilling obligations under the Protocol

<p>On the definition of units, CANADA noted divergence on the concept of fungibility among the Protocol mechanisms

 Regarding the sections on competitiveness, market size and structure, relationship to domestic policies, and liability for sales of non-surplus units, the G-77/CHINA said such headings are not neutral and recommended changing them

 CANADA said reference to "competitiveness" should be changed to "access to emissions trading

<p><em>Non-Annex I communications contact group: </em>The contact group met to discuss proposed draft decisions submitted by the EU and the G-77/CHINA and to decide on ways to proceed in preparation for COP-5

 The G-77/CHINA, supported by the MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAUDI ARABIA, INDONESIA and BRAZIL, proposed convening the workshop immediately prior to COP-5’s opening, to ensure stronger developing country participation

 The EU, supported by JAPAN and the US, proposed de-coupling the workshop with the COP-5 process, noting that there will be too many competing responsibilities

 AUSTRALIA, with CANADA, proposed holding the workshop well in advance of COP-5 to ensure that participants will have time to fully benefit from the discussions

 RUSSIA suggested exercising caution in approaching the experiences of other conventions, as the FCCC is unique

 The G-77/CHINA, with SAUDI ARABIA and IRAN, stressed the need to ensure that those developing country participants interested in attending are sponsored

<p>In a section of the draft conclusions requesting Parties not using the common reporting format for certain sectoral background data tables on LULUCF to specify alternative formats, CHINA added a specific reference noting that this request included Annex I Parties

 In addition, CHINA deleted reference to an instruction that a document reflecting the status of discussions on the non-inventory part of the guidelines be produced "in English only

<p>Regarding cooperation with other conventions, SWITZERLAND said cooperation should not only be limited to the secretariats

 CANADA, with ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA, stated that whereas broad cooperation between the conventions was desirable, it is still unclear how it would work, and preferred retaining the current language

 The PHILIPPINES deleted a reference to the scope of enabling activities, including various activities that facilitate the implementation of Convention Articles 4

 The PHILIPPINES, with the EU, suggested continuing consideration of this issue at the next session

 The conclusions also suggested that the list of projects submitted by non-Annex I Parties be brought to the attention of GEF and "as appropriate" other financing agencies, and required the contact group’s Co-Chairs to prepare a framework on elements of a draft decision, based on proposals by the G-77/CHINA and the EU

<p>On timing for non-Annex I national communications, the SBI considered draft conclusions by the Co-Chairs of the contact group, including proposed draft decisions by the G-77/CHINA and the EU as annexes

 An amendment was proposed by the PHILIPPINES requesting the Co-Chairs of the contact group on non-Annex I communications to prepare a document providing a framework for "elements for draft decisions," based on the G-77/CHINA and the EU proposals contained in the annexes

 On FCCC reporting guidelines on projections, policies and measures, financial resources, transfer of technology and other matters, CANADA noted SBSTA’s agreement to hold further discussion

 The EU and JAPAN supported a common reporting format (CRF) proposed for inventory data guidelines

 CANADA stressed substance, not timing, as the most important consideration and, with POLAND, said it is impractical for Parties to report on all climate change-related policies and measures

<p>In a section of the draft conclusions requesting Parties not using the common reporting format for certain sectoral background data tables on land use, land-use change and forestry to specify alternative formats, CHINA added a specific reference noting that this request included Annex I Parties

 POLAND noted that if Parties decide to change inventory methodology, artificial reduction of emissions may occur, and proposed recalculating emissions whenever the COP adopts new or amended emissions inventory methodology

</p> <p>On allocation of bunker emissions, AUSTRALIA highlighted the need to establish a policy framework and adopt the most suitable method of recording emissions

 Stating that this is a complicated process, JAPAN called on ICAO and IMO to provide the information necessary to help identify possible solutions

 BRAZIL reported on a recent workshop held to consider its proposal on determining responsibility based on historical emissions

</p> <p>On Friday, 11 June, ARGENTINA raised the issue of the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in metered dose inhalers for asthma treatment

 THAILAND offered to host a regional workshop

 EGYPT emphasized the need to make publicly-owned technology available to developing countries and expressed concern about the limited attention given to adaptation technologies

 AUSTRALIA stressed the importance of country-specific market-based approaches, the private sector and the role of the CDM in facilitating technology transfer

 </p> <p>The G-77/CHINA stated that technology transfer could not take place under the market process

 The PHILIPPINES, with CAMEROON, said technology transfer should be tackled as a commitment, not as a commercial undertaking

 CANADA stated that technology transfer is critical to achieving the long-term goals of the Convention and Protocol

 CANADA, with the EU and RUSSIA, urged support for GCOS

 CHINA, with the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, said the item on the timing of second non-Annex I communications was premature, as only 11 developing countries had submitted first national communications

 On FCCC reporting guidelines on projections, policies and measures, financial resources, transfer of technology and other matters, CANADA noted SBSTA’s agreement to hold further discussions

 AUSTRALIA supported revision of guidelines for non-Annex I communications and said the revision should be complete before the lodgement date of second national communications

 The G-77/CHINA called for clear guidance on financial and technical support and said the GEF did not provide adequate funding

 BOTSWANA, ZIMBABWE and the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC said the preparation of national communications should be an ongoing process and noted that practical difficulties faced by non-Annex I Parties impede the necessary continuity

 TOGO noted that it was premature to think about guidelines for second communications, as most non-Annex I countries were still preparing their first

 </p> <p>On Wednesday, 9 June, the contact group met to discuss proposed draft decisions submitted by the EU and the G-77/CHINA and to decide on how to proceed in preparation for COP-5

 On the input from Parties to the GEF review of enabling activities, the PHILIPPINES deleted a reference in the draft conclusions to the scope of enabling activities, including various activities that facilitate the implementation of Convention Articles 4

 At the request of the PHILIPPINES and the EU, the conclusions accepted continuing consideration of this issue at SBI’s next session

 The conclusions also suggested that the list of projects submitted by non-Annex I Parties be brought to the attention of the GEF and, "as appropriate," other financing agencies, and required the contact group’s Co-Chairs to prepare a framework on elements of a draft decision, based on proposals by the G-77/CHINA and the EU

6) by the Co-Chairs of the contact group, including proposed draft decisions by the G-77/CHINA and the EU as annexes

 The conclusions include a provision requesting the Co-Chairs of the contact group to prepare a miscellaneous document providing a framework for comparing the views of the G-77/CHINA and the EU as contained in the annexes

 An amendment was proposed by the PHILIPPINES calling for "elements for draft decisions" to be prepared instead

 CANADA and SLOVENIA preferred the high-level segment but without formal oral presentations

 SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA cautioned against introducing controversial issues that could "torpedo" the success of COP-5

 </p> <p>The G-77/CHINA tabled a draft decision on arrangements for COP-5

 </p> <p>The NETHERLANDS announced its offer to host COP-6 in the Hague and said Parties should decide whether it should be held in 2000 or 2001

 The G-77/CHINA preferred scheduling COP-6 in October or November 2000, and objected to additional intersessional meetings of the subsidiary bodies

 The PHILIPPINES stressed that capacity building was for developing countries and not the Secretariat

 IRAN, with CHINA, BRAZIL, SAUDI ARABIA, INDIA and the PHILIPPINES, expressed concern at the steep increase in the proposed budget’s expenditure levels

 The G-77/CHINA stated that it cannot support the extent of the proposed increase and noted the current trend among many Parties to support zero-growth budgets

 The EU, supported by the US, CANADA and RUSSIA, suggested that the Secretariat prepare other options for a draft budget

 The PHILIPPINES noted that a budget increase did not necessarily benefit the Parties

 </p> <p>In reference to certain programme activities outlined in the budget, CHINA stated that the Secretariat was not mandated to provide policy guidance to Parties but rather the other way around

 EGYPT suggested streamlining FCCC programme activities in areas covered by other entities

</p> <p>On contingencies for conference services, the G-77/CHINA said the UN General Assembly should be asked to include the FCCC’s requirements in its budget

 INDIA, supported by CHINA, expressed his appreciation for the transparency with which the consultations took place and requested more detailed information in time for COP-5 on staffing requirements and the extent of use of consultants from developing countries

 JAPAN stated it had diverging views on the use of carry-overs as set out in the draft decision, noted its support for the Secretariat, and said it would not stand in the way of consensus

 </p> <p>On compliance under the Protocol, the G-77/CHINA said Annex I Parties’ communications should include information on Convention implementation, particularly: policies and measures to modify longer term trends; new and additional financial resources; assistance to meet adaptation costs; technology transfer; and capacity building of developing countries

 The G-77/CHINA called for a discussion on the basic principles for a compliance regime, noted a lack of submissions received from developing countries and supported the compilation of views through a questionnaire

 The G-77/CHINA indicated that it had not reached a group position on these items

 On identification of compliance-related elements and gaps, the US, with CANADA and the EU, indicated the need to differentiate elements from gaps and proposed three categories to identify them: substantive rules; procedures for addressing compliance; and consequences of non-compliance

 The US emphasized the importance of transparency and, with JAPAN, called for reasonable certainty about the consequences of non-compliance

 JAPAN said the system may need a short grace period at the end of the commitment period

 AOSIS cautioned against attempting to differentiate legally binding from non-legally binding obligations, and IRAN underscored the legally-binding character of the Protocol

 CHINA said Article 18 (non-compliance) applies to all obligations under the Protocol

 AUSTRALIA said a distinction between binding and non-binding aspects would be necessary for practical reasons

 AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, opposed by the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, stressed the benefits of peer reviews, rather than a punitive regime, to enforce obligations

 The EU, supported by JAPAN and AOSIS, noted its preference for a system that combines "hard" and "soft" enforcement measures that are graded according to the gravity of the breach and the nature of the obligation

 </p> <p>On Saturday, 5 June, the G-77/CHINA presented its position on compliance to the JWG

 On the nature and timing of the informal exchange, later referred to as a "workshop," the G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA and IRAN, preferred holding it after COP-5, but before the subsidiary bodies’ 12th sessions (SB-12)

 The EU, CANADA, the US and AUSTRALIA supported holding it prior to COP-5 in order to better prepare for it

 The G-77/CHINA and others expressed concern at the lack of regional balance in the distribution of pilot projects and said the AIJ project experience internationally was inadequate for a meaningful review

 SWITZERLAND called for the development of terms of reference for the review of the pilot phase for consideration by COP-5

 The US, with JAPAN and GUATEMALA, said experiences gained from AIJ projects could provide valuable lessons for the development of Protocol mechanisms

 IRAN opposed linking AIJ with the CDM since it does not include a credit element and lacks adequate reference to sustainable development

 The group was unable to start substantive deliberations until the second week when the G-77/CHINA circulated its position paper

</p> <p>In an initial exchange of views during the first joint Plenary session on Tuesday, 1 June, the G-77/CHINA stressed the need to, inter alia: begin with formulating principles to guide the methodological and operational process; establish a common understanding of the mechanisms; and ensure that the nature and scope of mechanisms do not perpetuate North-South inequities

 The US, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, NORWAY, NEW ZEALAND and CANADA opposed the EU proposal to place caps on the use of the Protocol mechanisms

 AOSIS said actions under the mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic action and, with SENEGAL, suggested that the mechanisms be guided by principles of equity and transparency

 SWITZERLAND, with the EU and AUSTRALIA, supported adopting the guidelines at COP-5

 AUSTRALIA said the guidelines may be applicable to Protocol inventories

 On obstacles to producing non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA called for provision of adequate financial resources, technical assistance and capacity-building to support non-Annex I countries in collecting data and identifying national emission factors and methodologies for adaptation assessment

 The EU, opposed by CHINA, said the GEF had provided most non-Annex I Parties with funding for national communications

 UZBEKISTAN noted that constraints included lack of research and data on emissions factors

 IRAN noted that countries also have needs determined by their unique circumstances

<p class="MsoNormal">On the advantages of producing non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA said that despite difficulties in identifying significant trends, the synthesis of initial non-Annex I communications was a first step in considering information related to FCCC implementation by non-Annex I Parties

 The EU, CANADA and MICRONESIA noted the usefulness of the compilation and synthesis report in better understanding the difficulties faced by non-Annex I Parties

<p class="MsoNormal">On guidelines for non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA opposed changing the guidelines, as many non-Annex I countries have not finalized their first communications

 SWITZERLAND said there is a need for one unified reporting format for all FCCC Parties and for the use of IPCC guidelines

<p class="MsoNormal">The G-77/CHINA called for an expert review of non-Annex I communications by non-Annex I Party experts

 ARGENTINA supported regional groups of experts

<p class="MsoNormal">On the timing of second national communications, the G-77/CHINA noted that there is a differentiated timetable under the FCCC for submission of national communications by Annex I and non-Annex I Parties

 The US, supported by CANADA and SWITZERLAND and opposed by CHINA, said the revision of guidelines was fundamental to improving second national communications

 Regarding the draft guidance for reporting on Global Climate Observation Systems (GCOS), the EU, with MONGOLIA, recommended that Annex I Parties prepare separate reports on global climate observation and include in their national communications a summary based on general reporting requirements

 AUSTRALIA suggested that projections of the effect of policies and measures on future trends of GHG emissions and removals be developed by sector

 The MARSHALL ISLANDS and JAMAICA supported detailed and rigorous reporting

 The G-77/CHINA said any consideration of the LULUCF process should begin after the release of the IPCC Special Report

<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>JAPAN, with AUSTRALIA, called for the establishment of a decision-making framework at COP-5

 AUSTRALIA stressed that the key question is not “whether” but “how” additional sink activities could be included in the Protocol

 CANADA said the decision-making framework should be based on consistency between the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol

<p class="MsoNormal">Regarding guidelines for national systems, the EU, with JAPAN, said they should be flexible in order to reflect different national circumstances

 AUSTRALIA proposed including, inter alia, quality assurance and quality control procedures, links between national systems and emissions trading systems and links with the transfer and acquisition of assigned amounts

 SWITZERLAND said guidelines should include criteria for national enforcement systems to comply with relevant guidelines, and the establishment and treatment of data related to Protocol mechanisms

<p class="MsoNormal">Regarding adjustments, AUSTRALIA said they are intended as an element of the Protocolï¿½s compliance system

 The EU and JAPAN stated that further discussion on technical aspects should only occur after the completion of IPCCï¿½s work on good practice

 CANADA noted the lack of clarity in what an adjustment would be

 The G-77/CHINA said it had highlighted the need for another workshop prior to COP-6

 AUSTRALIA, with CANADA and the GAMBIA, said the absence of information on the effect of policies and measures should not be an obstacle to meeting the needs of the truly vulnerable

 CANADA and SAMOA highlighted the need to act through the national communications process

 SENEGAL called for an evaluation of vulnerability in Africa by COP-6

<p class="MsoNormal">On the impact of response measures on the economies of oil producing and other countries, SAUDI ARABIA referred to recent studies suggesting oil producing countries will suffer economically from response measures and, with KUWAIT and LIBYA, said developed countries should remove market distortions in the energy sector

 JAPAN and the MARSHALL ISLANDS said consideration of compensation was unacceptable as it is not provided for in the FCCC or the Protocol

<p class="MsoNormal">On the status of negotiations, several delegates, including SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, QATAR and the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, said equal progress must be made on all issues, and the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) should be achieved as a complete package

 The PHILIPPINES recommended that capacity building be “for,” “by” and “in” developing countries and said the GEF initiative was the antithesis of capacity building

 CANADA, supporting the GEF initiative, urged the GEF to further develop its interagency approach

 CANADA supported a coordinated response among existing efforts in capacity building and proposed three steps: assessment of needs; overview of actions currently undertaken by various actors; and definition of a clear scope for action

 AUSTRALIA sought information from the Secretariat on current support for developing countries in order to identify gaps and needs for future work

 NORWAY favored an integrated approach for the identification of needs

 SWITZERLAND endorsed a practical approach focused on identifying appropriate needs in specific areas

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY:</i> On the experience with AIJ, the G-77/CHINA underlined the imbalance of the geographical distribution of pilot projects and urged extension of the pilot phase

 With the MARSHALL ISLANDS, BOTSWANA and SAMOA, he opposed linking AIJ to the Protocol mechanisms

 JAPAN, supported by the EU, said the experience gained is sufficient for a comprehensive review

 With POLAND, he stressed that an AIJ project should be eligible under joint implementation (JI) or CDM if it meets the criteria for eligibility and if the Parties involved agree

<p class="MsoNormal">Opposed by AOSIS, BOTSWANA and IRAN, the EU, with SWITZERLAND, proposed that AIJ should be credited retroactively

 SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA said that without credit, industries would be cautious about AIJ

 BOTSWANA said introducing crediting would confuse the process

<p class="MsoNormal">On the reporting format, SWITZERLAND stressed simplicity

<p class="MsoNormal">The G-77/CHINA said a CDM decision must precede decisions on other mechanisms

 AUSTRALIA noted the need for considerable technical work prior to COP-6

 In view of the workload to meet the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA), the US, with CANADA, AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND, said COP-6 should be held early in 2001 with various intersessional activities on the run-up

 CHINA said the BAPA only calls for “demonstrable progress” by COP-6

 To maintain political momentum, JAPAN noted its preference for COP-6 in November 2000

 SWITZERLAND said timing of COP-6 should result from progress on pending issues and highlighted the need for a work-plan

 The G-77/CHINA called for informal consultations by Chair Ashe

 AUSTRALIA, the US and the EU highlighted the potential role of the clean development mechanism (CDM) in technology transfer

 The PHILIPPINES, with SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA, stressed that technology transfer was a commitment under the FCCC and opposed linking it to the CDM

 The PHILIPPINES called for information on technology transfer activities in Annex-I communications

 The G-77/CHINA called for a COP-5 decision on capacity building

 SWITZERLAND underscored consideration of specific national circumstances

 AUSTRALIA preferred reference to “good” rather than “best” practices and, with JAPAN and the US, said P&amp;Ms should reflect national circumstances

 The REPUBLIC OF KOREA, supported by AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND and JAPAN, said it was premature to discuss allocation due to the difficulties in differentiating emissions resulting from national and international fuel

<p class="MsoNormal">On the impact of single projects on emissions in the commitment period, ICELAND said single projects have a greater proportional impact on emissions in smaller countries, affecting their ability to meet emissions targets

 CANADA expressed reservations on the issue and opposed the draft decision tabled by Iceland at COP-4 in its current form

 The EU and PERU, opposed by MALAYSIA, said the issue should be considered as part of IPCC’s Third Assessment Report

 The PHILIPPINES and CHINA recommended consideration of the G-77/China capacity-building draft decision

 UGANDA proposed a permanent clearing-house to streamline funding

 The G-77/CHINA said its draft decision should serve as the basis for a recommendation to COP-5, since it presents a comprehensive approach to all capacity building activities and specifies developing countries’ needs in its annex

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS: </i>The Chair distributed a draft text compiling the EU and G-77/CHINA proposals on non-Annex I communications

 ARGENTINA, supported by KENYA, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and POLAND, called for attention to the medical use of HFCs in metered dose inhalers

 JAPAN encouraged GCOS, in cooperation with the WMO, to monitor the status of implementation with a view to utilizing recent technologies to fill the gaps in climate observing systems

 AUSTRALIA called for a more diversified funding strategy

 While the EU objected, CANADA supported additional rosters for inventory reviews

 In presenting its preliminary views, JAPAN proposed a single compliance body and outlined steps ranging from assistance to recommendations to be exhausted before the entry into force of consequences

 CANADA said sufficient evidence should be provided to support cases

 IRAN said only a group of Parties could trigger a case of another Party’s compliance

 The EU, CANADA, CHINA, JAPAN, IRAN, SOUTH AFRICA and the US opposed a triggering role for the Secretariat

 CANADA said the reports were the factual basis that determined the need for further steps

 CHINA, with IRAN, KUWAIT, BRAZIL and ARGENTINA said it was inappropriate to give ERTs, a simple fact finding body, a triggering role

 The US and AUSTRALIA suggested guidelines for a possible referral to the compliance body

 SWITZERLAND, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and CHINA proposed that the COP/MOP should have a triggering role as well as the competence to decide on the findings of the compliance body

 BRAZIL suggested that the COP/MOP only take note of the compliance body report

<p class="MsoNormal">On sources of information, AUSTRALIA and the US said that due process required the defending party to be able to present necessary information and rebut evidence against it

 SAMOA suggested any source the compliance body deemed appropriate, while IRAN said Parties should be the only source

 BRAZIL said sources should bear responsibility for their information

<p class="MsoNormal">The EU, with BRAZIL, stressed the need to ensure confidentiality of information submitted in confidence by Parties

 CHINA sought criteria for the use of information

 IRAN raised the issue of financing developing countries’ efforts to provide information

 The EU, NORWAY and the US suggested ways of consolidating and tightening the text

 On the CDM, the G-77/CHINA pointed to deficiencies in the text, including the absence of a section on ï¿½nature and scopeï¿½ and the lack of a determination of what the driving force of the CDM should be

 The G-77/CHINA said technical appendices complicate the issue and stressed the need to address the technical issues

 JAPAN presented an alternative draft of the annex, which he said aimed at greater clarity

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS: </i>Participants considered a draft text compiling proposals by the EU, the G-77/CHINA and others

 The EU said meetings should be held regularly, and SWITZERLAND suggested it meet at least once a year, given the continuous work of the compliance body

 POLAND said there should be an equal number of Protocol Annex B and non-Annex B Parties, and AUSTRALIA, supported by the US, added that the composition would depend upon the article under review

 SWITZERLAND, with SOUTH AFRICA, said it should be possible to call on outside experts

 The EU said these rules should be adopted by the body itself, while KUWAIT, BRAZIL and CHINA said the COP/MOP should adopt these rules

<p class="MsoNormal">On the consequences of non-compliance, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the US said the term “consequence” could be replaced by “outcome,” in order to better reflect the possible use of facilitative measures

 CHINA, with SOUTH AFRICA, specified that Protocol Article 18 (compliance) refers to “binding consequences” and opposed the proposed terminology change

 JAPAN said the cost of sanctions should be lower than the cost of withdrawal from the Protocol

 The US, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA and CANADA said a possible sanction could be the subtraction of excess emissions from the levels permitted during the subsequent period, with a penalty rate applied

 SWITZERLAND, BRAZIL and IRAN supported financial penalties as a last resort

 AUSTRALIA said the Party concerned should have the option to choose from a menu of consequences

 CHINA, INDONESIA and IRAN highlighted the need to convene intersessional meetings to strengthen intergovernmental work

 JAPAN and CANADA said both technical workshops and intersessional meetings should be held prior to COP-6

 CANADA added that it would like to see a refined negotiating text at COP-6

 The G-77/CHINA and others highlighted the need for transparency in the process and adequate developing country expert participation in the technical workshops

 SUDAN said Parties needed time to review the information and findings of technical workshops

<p class="MsoNormal">The G-77/CHINA said it was premature to work toward a draft negotiating text, as Parties were still at the stage of making submissions, noting convergence/divergence and synthesizing views

 In response to a query by Chair Chow, the G-77/CHINA defined a draft negotiating text as “the penultimate stage in the text that the COP will finally adopt

” JAPAN, the US and AUSTRALIA defined it as a living document that would go through several drafts

1 (national systems for GHG emissions and removals) that had been presented by JAPAN and amended after informal consultations by a smaller group of Parties

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS:</i> Chair El Ghaouth (Mauritania) informed delegates that a drafting group had been working on a draft text compiling proposals by the EU, the G-77/CHINA and others, and suggested that the contact group adjourn to allow the drafting group to continue its work

 SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA, the US, NIGERIA and BRAZIL said the paper developed by the Co-Chairs should be based on more sources of information

 CHINA, IRAN and SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by the EU and AUSTRALIA, suggested that the paper serve as a basis for “consideration” of compliance

 NIGERIA added that nothing in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) required the JWG to finish its work by COP-6

 NEW ZEALAND, with AUSTRALIA, ARGENTINA, the US, the EU, BAHAMAS, CHILE and the FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA, sought to retain the phrase “complete its work,” as Parties had a responsibility to achieve the objectives of the BAPA and it would be difficult to justify a less ambitious goal

 CHINA, NIGERIA and SAUDI ARABIA sought alternative language supporting substantial progress by COP-6

 The G-77/CHINA said it had prepared a draft decision covering similar aspects and including others such as guidance on the scope of the workshop on the IPCC Special Report

 Many delegations noted similarities between the two texts, and agreed to follow the sequencing of paragraphs in the G-77/CHINA proposal as a basis for discussions

 The G-77/CHINA stressed the need to address the CDM’s driving force, nature and scope

 AUSTRALIA said the CDM should be largely private sector driven

 NORWAY inquired about the role of operational entities in the validation and pre-registration of project proposals, noting that the Executive Board may not be able to carry out this task

<p class="MsoNormal">SOUTH AFRICA, the SUDAN, BOLIVIA, MEXICO and MAURITANIA suggested that the CDM include the concept of emissions avoidance

 BOLIVIA proposed including forest protection initiatives under emissions avoidance

 MEXICO said he looked forward to using the CDM to supplement national efforts to shift from slash-and-burn techniques, which are responsible for loss of forest cover, to sustainable technologies that would have a positive impact on climate change

 MAURITANIA objected to the inclusion of forest protection within the CDM, as Parties would seek to protect their forests regardless of its inclusion

 IRAN said the CDM should include projects related to both sinks and sources

 MOROCCO stressed the need to certify that reduced or avoided emissions are real, measurable and contribute to sustainable development in the host country

 With SWITZERLAND, she said CDM projects should be subjected to rigorous impact assessment studies that take into account the socio-economic aspects of the host country

 MAURITANIA asked how transparency of and accountability for the investment will be ensured

<p class="MsoNormal">On unilateral funding of CDM projects, JAPAN asked whether unilaterally-funded projects were consistent with the concept of CDM

 COLOMBIA highlighted the potential of indigenous private sector projects

 The G-77/CHINA emphasized that CDM funding should be over and above ODA, GEF and other financial commitments

 JAPAN said there were no provisions requiring financial additionality and none that preclude the use of ODA as a source of funding

 The G-77/CHINA said funding additionality flows from the fact that the purpose of the CDM is to assist Annex I Parties in attaining their commitments <o:p> </o:p> </p> 

 The G-77/CHINA said it was clear from the agreement at COP-4 that second national communications would be funded without further guidelines

5), further informal consultations were scheduled after the G-77/CHINA said it had been unable to participate in the drafting group working on this issue due to the heavy workload at COP-5

 He noted many areas of concern and said the G-77/CHINA needed time to develop its position

 AUSTRALIA, the US and the EU supported the calendar of events

 INDIA and CHINA proposed deletion of a paragraph that calls on the CG to consider steps taken or envisaged by the Party to implement the FCCC

 A number of delegates agreed to work on the basis of the Co-Chairs’ proposals, while SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT and the UAE said these drafts did not reflect their concerns and sought to proceed on the basis of an earlier version

<p class="MsoNormal">On a paragraph in the draft conclusions outlining progress at SB-10 and SB-11, AUSTRALIA and the US suggested replacing “procedures and mechanisms” relating to a compliance system with “procedures and processes,” in order to include consideration of Protocol Articles 8 (expert review teams) and 16 (dispute settlement)

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>MECHANISMS:</i> On CDM project monitoring, MAURITANIA said monitoring and reporting should not burden the host country

 BOLIVIA suggested that Parties monitor their own projects and ï¿½learn by doing

ï¿½ NORWAY and AUSTRALIA said that project participants, the host Party or a designated legal entity should monitor

 On Article 6 project validation, JAPAN cautioned against creating unnecessary bureaucracies

 CANADA and the US noted that Protocol Article 8 (review of information) provides a built-in review

<p class="MsoNormal">Statements by observer States, IGOs, NGOs and UN bodies: On progress made in climate change negotiations, PALAU said it was disappointed at the lack of progress being made at COP-5

 The G-77/CHINA said differences in the nature, scope, purpose of and participation in the three mechanisms should be decided before making decisions on modalities, operational and methodological issues and institutional arrangements

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>CDM:</i> The G-77/CHINA indicated that the host government should determine whether a particular project meets its sustainable development objectives

 SLOVAKIA, on behalf of the VISEGRAD Group of central European countries, said rules on JI and CDM should enter the implementing phase simultaneously

 The G-77/CHINA called for a comprehensive, efficient and fair compliance system

 ARGENTINA announced that it had adopted a voluntary target to reduce its GHG emissions, noting that it does not intend to abandon its status as a non-Annex I Party

 KAZAKHSTAN said it intended to join FCCC Annex I

 JAPAN, the US, AUSTRALIA and others welcomed the initiatives by Kazakhstan and Argentina

 CHINA and INDIA said Annex I countries have the main responsibility

 CHINA said it would not undertake commitments until it achieves a “medium development level

 The G-77/CHINA and AOSIS expressed disappointment at recent emissions data revealing that many Annex I Parties are significantly exceeding 1990 levels

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Capacity building:</i> The G-77/CHINA, the AFRICA GROUP and others said capacity building is necessary to ensure meaningful participation from developing countries

 BANGLADESH called on Parties to earmark funds from the GEF for LDCs

 GERMANY urged donor countries to provide the financial means to assure the operations of the GEF

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Non-Annex I communications: </i>The G-77/CHINA highlighted insufficient financial resources to meet the “agreed full costs” in the preparation of non-Annex I communications

 The G-77/CHINA said the nature and scope of emissions trading must be determined before operational details are worked out

 SWITZERLAND suggested a ï¿½post-verification modelï¿½ wherein emission reduction units could not be transferred until they have been certified to be excess Assigned Amount Units

 BHUTAN and BANGLADESH called for special attention to LDCs’ needs

 SWITZERLAND, JAPAN and the NETHERLANDS urged Parties not to wait for ratification before starting to implement actions to address climate change

<p class="MsoNormal">On lessons learned, FINLAND, with CANADA, underscored good working relationships between all partners and stakeholders in implementing climate change policies

 With SWITZERLAND and HUNGARY, she emphasized the need for increased domestic action and called for continuation of AIJ and a smooth transition in the future to the clean development mechanism (CDM) and joint implementation (JI)

<p class="MsoNormal">The PHILIPPINES and CANADA recommended the use of no-regrets policies

 MALAYSIA and MEXICO sought consistency in policies between different environmental fora

 BULGARIA called for a meeting to address the specific features of countries with economies in transition (EITs) before COP-6

 GERMANY said addressing climate change could create new jobs

 IRAN highlighted the need for confidence-building between developed and developing countries through concrete practical cooperation

 CHINA said attempts by some Parties to get developing countries to “meaningfully participate” were destroying confidence-building efforts between developing and developed countries

<p class="MsoNormal">On outcomes from COP-5, the UK, supported by KAZAKHSTAN and the US, and opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed a Bonn Declaration reaffirming the political will to complete the BAPA by COP-6

 KUWAIT said the proposal for a Bonn Declaration was premature

 ARGENTINA, supported by FINLAND and BENIN, said innovative approaches were needed and called for the establishment of small task forces in the run-up to COP-6

<p class="MsoNormal">JAPAN, supported by KAZAKHSTAN, BOTSWANA, the US, CANADA, BENIN, ICELAND, HONDURAS and SOUTH AFRICA, suggested that COP-5 President Szyszko (Poland) be empowered to appoint a special facilitator to assist negotiations and help Parties realize the BAPA by COP-6

 BELGIUM supported a flexible approach focused on achieving successful outcomes and said a COW or another new structure should be transparent and monitored by all Parties

<p class="MsoNormal">CHINA, with SAUDI ARABIA, VENEZUELA, KUWAIT, INDONESIA, and LIBYA, opposed the proposals to establish new groups or mechanisms to assist progress toward COP-6, stressing that the existing FCCC bodies and structures should be employed to this end

 CHINA, supported by KUWAIT and others, said a facilitator would not be able to visit and confer with all Parties

 NORWAY said ministers should be engaged in the process between the COPs

 The UK, CHILE, MICRONESIA, COOK ISLANDS, SWITZERLAND, the US, TUVALU, AOSIS, CANADA, JAPAN, AUSTRIA, KIRIBATI, the EU, NEW ZEALAND, FRANCE, the GAMBIA, BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA, AUSTRALIA, SLOVENIA, NORWAY, POLAND, BELGIUM and GERMANY supported the adoption of the Co-Chairs’ draft decision in its current form

 QATAR, KUWAIT, the SUDAN, VENEZUELA, SAUDI ARABIA, LIBYA, ALGERIA, NIGERIA, SYRIA, OMAN and JORDAN suggested alternative language whereby the JWG would report to COP-6 “with a view” to adopting a decision on a compliance system, as this would be more consistent with the BAPA

 IRAN requested SAUDI ARABIA and the countries on whose behalf it spoke to join the consensus

 The EU, with AUSTRALIA and CANADA, opposed it as the GEF would not be able to provide the support the IPCC required

 CHINA said the GEF ï¿½cakeï¿½ was barely enough to go around 130 developing countries

 BRAZIL favored the reference as the GEF was the FCCC financial mechanism and a significant proportion of the IPCCï¿½s finances are used to finance developing country participation

 The NETHERLANDS noted the high expectations set for COP-6 and said that its success will lie in producing a package addressing the concerns of all Parties

1), were adopted after CHINA amended the text to state that the purpose of the technical review is to assist “Annex I Parties” instead of “all Parties” in gaining experience relevant to the preparation of guidelines related to Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8

2(a) and (b) (policies and measures by Annex I Parties), following objections to the title by the G-77/CHINA, who preferred to substitute it with the “review of adequacy of implementation of FCCC Articles 4

 The COP adopted the agenda including item 5 as it stood, and recorded the amendment proposed by the G-77/CHINA in a footnote

 During SBI discussions, the G-77/CHINA proposed holding COP-6 in November 2000, while the US, with CANADA, AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND, preferred early 2001

 Regarding the draft guidance for reporting on global climate observation systems, the EU, with MONGOLIA, recommended that Annex I Parties prepare a separate report and include in their national communications a summary based on general reporting requirements

1) after CHINA amended the text to state that the purpose of the technical review is to assist “Annex I Parties” instead of “all Parties” in gaining experience relevant to the preparation of guidelines related to Protocol Articles 5 (methodology), 7 (communication) and 8 (review of information)

<p class="MsoNormal">On obstacles to producing non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA called for provision of adequate financial resources, technical assistance and capacity building to support non-Annex I Parties in collecting data and identifying national emissions factors and methodologies for adaptation assessment

 The EU, opposed by CHINA, said the Global Environment Facility (GEF) had provided most non-Annex I Parties with funding for national communications

 IRAN noted that countries have needs determined by their unique circumstances

<p class="MsoNormal">The G-77/CHINA opposed changing the guidelines for non-Annex I communications, as many non-Annex I countries have not finalized their first communications

<p class="MsoNormal">The G-77/CHINA called for the involvement of non-Annex I Party experts in preparing non-Annex I communications

<p class="MsoNormal">On the timing of second national communications, the G-77/ CHINA noted that there is a differentiated timetable under the FCCC for submission of national communications by Annex I and non-Annex I Parties

 The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the EU and others, said its proposal should serve as the basis for the group’s discussions

 INDIA and CHINA proposed deletion of a paragraph that calls on the CGE to consider steps taken or envisaged by the Party to implement the FCCC

<p class="MsoNormal">Many delegates welcomed the G-77/CHINA proposal for a draft decision on capacity building (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/MISC

 AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN and UZBEKISTAN said that capacity building was necessary to take full advantage of the CDM

 AUSTRALIA, the US and the EU highlighted the potential role of the CDM in technology transfer

 The PHILIPPINES called for information on technology transfer activities in Annex I communications

 ARGENTINA and others called for attention to the medical use of HFCs in metered dose inhalers

 SENEGAL called for evaluation of vulnerability in Africa by COP-6

 JAPAN and the MARSHALL ISLANDS said consideration of compensation was unacceptable, since it is not provided for in the FCCC or the Protocol

<p class="MsoNormal">In the joint SBI/SBSTA session on Tuesday, 26 October, the G-77/CHINA underlined the imbalance of the geographical distribution of pilot projects and urged extension of the pilot phase

 With POLAND, he stressed that an AIJ project should be eligible under JI or the CDM if it meets the criteria for eligibility and if the Parties involved agree to do so

 The EU and SWITZERLAND, opposed by AOSIS, BOTSWANA and IRAN, proposed that AIJ be credited retroactively

 IRAN noted the absence of criteria for assessing and elaborating the benefits of AIJ projects and said these were subject to different interpretations

 On Saturday, 30 October, the G-77/CHINA tabled its proposed draft decision whereby the COP decides to conclude the review process and take a conclusive decision on the pilot phase and the progression beyond that at COP-6

 The EU and PERU, opposed by MALAYSIA, said the issue should be considered as part of IPCC’s TAR

 The US, MEXICO and GEORGIA supported the proposal

 CANADA said the decision-making framework should be based on consistency between the provisions of the Protocol

 The group decided to base its discussions on draft conclusions that contained a work programme proposed by the G-77/CHINA

 The G-77/CHINA said a CDM decision must precede decisions on other mechanisms

<p class="MsoNormal">On working towards a draft negotiating text, the G-77/CHINA said this was premature, since Parties were still at the stage of making submissions, noting convergence/divergence and synthesizing views

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Clean Development Mechanism: </i>On the project cycle of the CDM, the G-77/CHINA stressed the need to address the CDM’s driving force, nature and scope

 SOUTH AFRICA, the SUDAN, BOLIVIA, MEXICO and MAURITANIA proposed including in the CDM the concept of emissions avoidance

 JAPAN asked whether unilaterally-funded projects were consistent with the concept of CDM

 COLOMBIA said that as long as CDM projects demonstrate additionality and lead to real and measurable long-term reductions, there should be flexibility in financing the projects

 Regarding the use of ODA and GEF funds, the G-77/CHINA emphasized that CDM funding should be additional to ODA and other financial commitments

<p class="MsoNormal">On CDM project monitoring, MAURITANIA said monitoring and reporting should not burden the host country

 BOLIVIA suggested that Parties monitor their own projects and “learn by doing

” NORWAY and AUSTRALIA said that project participants, the host Party or a designated legal entity should monitor

 JAPAN responded that each Party should decide on its own and added that creating unnecessary bureaucracies would discourage Annex I Parties from entering into JI

 CANADA, with the US, noted that the review of additionality for JI projects would be under Article 8 (review of information)

 SWITZERLAND suggested a “post-verification model” wherein emission reduction units could not be transferred until they have been certified to be excess Assigned Amount Units (AAUs)

 The G-77/CHINA said that while AAUs derive from past emissions and are retrospective, CERs derive from the future and are prospective

 FRANCE said while trading in CERs is safe, trading in AAUs could be unsafe if the country transferring them ran into compliance trouble at the end of its budget period

 CANADA said it was open to the notion of a core set of guidelines for the creation of national registries, noting that one central registry could be problematic

 In presenting its preliminary views, JAPAN proposed a single compliance body and outlined steps ranging from technical/financial assistance to a series of recommendations such as strengthening of reporting requirements

 AUSTRALIA said its compliance procedure focused on Protocol Article 3

 A number of developing countries, opposed by NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the US, said the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities should apply

 JAPAN and SWITZERLAND proposed a single body exercising its facilitative and enforcement functions in a graduated manner

 CANADA said the reports would be the factual basis that determined the need for further steps

 CHINA, with IRAN, KUWAIT, BRAZIL and ARGENTINA, said it was inappropriate to give ERTs, a simple fact finding body, a triggering role

<p class="MsoNormal">On the role of the COP/MOP, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and CHINA, opposed by SOUTH AFRICA, proposed that it have a triggering role as well as the competence to decide on the findings of the compliance body

 AUSTRALIA and the US said the defending party should be able to rebut evidence against it

 POLAND said there should be an equal number of Protocol Annex B and non-Annex B Parties, and AUSTRALIA, supported by the US, added that the composition would depend on the article under review

 Discussions focused on the level of ambition of the JWG, in particular whether it should “complete its work” at COP-6, as proposed by the EU, the US and others, or “make substantial progress” at COP-6, as supported by SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, UAE and others

 IRAN requested SAUDI ARABIA to join the consensus regarding the level of ambition of the JWG

 ICELAND said single projects, such as a large industrial plant, have a greater proportional impact on emissions in smaller countries, affecting their ability to meet emissions targets

<p class="MsoNormal">Regarding guidelines for national systems, the EU, with JAPAN, said they should be flexible in order to reflect differing national circumstances

 AUSTRALIA proposed including, inter alia, quality assurance and quality control procedures, links between national systems and emissions trading systems, and links with the transfer and acquisition of AAUs

<p class="MsoNormal">Regarding adjustments, CANADA noted the lack of clarity in what an adjustment would be

 AUSTRALIA said adjustments are intended as an element of the Protocol’s compliance system

 The EU and JAPAN stated that further discussion on technical aspects should only occur after the completion of the IPCC’s work on good practice

 AUSTRALIA preferred reference to “good” rather than “best” practices and, with JAPAN and the US, said policies and measures should reflect national circumstances

 The US, with POLAND, stressed that timeliness and completeness of submissions were critical in providing a basis for COP action

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Protocol Ratification:</i> Numerous Parties supported the Protocol’s entry into force by Rio+10 in 2002 including, inter alia: BULGARIA, CARICOM, the EU, FRANCE, GERMANY, HAITI, IRELAND, ITALY, JAPAN, SPAIN, SWEDEN, and the UK

 The G-77/CHINA said differences in the nature, scope, purpose of and participation in the three mechanisms should be determined first

 AUSTRALIA proposed establishing a Committee of the Whole (COW), chaired by a facilitator vested with the authority by President Szyszko

 On progress made in climate change negotiations, PALAU said it was disappointed at the lack of progress being made at COP-5

<p class="MsoNormal">In its closing Plenary on Friday, 5 November, the COP adopted the report of its work with a minor amendment by the G-77/CHINA and authorized Rapporteur Guerreiro to finalize the report (FCCC/CP/1999/L

<p class="MsoNormal">The G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA and the EU, highlighted the cordial and businesslike atmosphere at COP-5

<p class="MsoNormal">CHINA noted the meaningful participation of the G-77/CHINA in the negotiation process

 KAZAKHSTAN and SYRIA thanked the host country for its hospitality

 CHINA queried if the ERTs could trigger cases of non-compliance

<p>Introducing her submission on the linkages between Article 8 and adjustments under Article 5, JAPAN highlighted the three stages of the inventory review process: initial check by the Secretariat; synthesis and assessment of inventories; and review by ERTs

<p>Following a question by BRAZIL on the compatibility of such a deduction with the objective of "making the atmosphere whole," she said this deduction, although necessary, would not be a sufficient incentive for ensuring compliance during the budget period

<p>DISCUSSION: AUSTRIA suggested that the Compliance Workshop identify common ground on the linkages between the compliance system and Articles 5, 7 and 8 and present it to the workshop on Articles 5, 7 and 8

 The UK and AUSTRALIA said that the identification of mandatory requirements under Articles 5, 7 and 8 should be left to the groups dealing with the mechanisms and Articles 5, 7 and 8

 NEW ZEALAND, with AUSTRALIA, CANADA, the US and JAPAN, stressed that Parties had a right to use the mechanisms until a breach had been identified through the review process

 JAPAN also questioned the EU distinction between a facilitative and an enforcement process and said assistance would always be helpful as a first step

 AUSTRALIA said Article 3

<p>On the composition of the compliance body, BRAZIL stressed the need to involve the entire international community

 CHINA asked what would happen to a case that had been referred to the facilitation component but despite exhausting all the assistance that component could offer, the Party was still in non-compliance

 CHINA, with the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES and NEW ZEALAND, said Parties should be the main initiators

 With BRAZIL and the US, she questioned the role of the ERTs in the process of referral since they were concerned only with technical information

 ARGENTINA said non-Annex I Parties should be able to refer a case of non-compliance with Article 3

 AUSTRALIA said ERTs had a technical assessment function and, accordingly, an essential referral function

 She opposed a possible screening role by the COP/MOP and said it was difficult to distinguish between a COP/MOP committee, as suggested by BRAZIL and SAUDI ARABIA, and a COP/MOP-established compliance body

 AUSTRALIA said a staged approach should apply to every issue and that there could be a three-month time limit for the facilitation process relating to eligibility in order to ensure timeliness

 JAPAN highlighted the difference between cases under Article 6

 JAPAN and SAMOA referred to their respective proposals for a compliance system and said that such an appeal would be available

 The US, with JAPAN, stressed the importance of due process in the enforcement procedure

 With AUSTRALIA, he added there should be a wide variety of sources of information that the compliance body could use, as appropriate

 AUSTRALIA, supported by BRAZIL and the UK, said the appeal procedure should be part of the compliance system and that Article 19 only applied to bilateral disputes

 On appeal, JAPAN said the Party concerned could ask the COP/MOP to take a decision on the need to re-examine the outcome of the compliance body

 Following a question by CANADA, she said the COP/ MOP itself could decide that a case needed to be reexamined

 JAPAN drew attention to the fact that although the COP/MOP plays a role as a general assembly and has a legitimizing function with respect to final decisions of the compliance body, due to the nature of COP/MOP it is practically difficult for it to consider all the relevant issues

 CANADA opposed the suggestion that the COP/MOP be entitled to ask the compliance body to re-examine a matter

 JAPAN said facilitative consequences would also apply to compliance issues related to the mechanisms and that there should be a staged approach in the case of non-compliance with Article 3

 JAPAN said the policies and measures that could be recommended by the compliance body would depend on the future work of the SBI and SBSTA on policies and measures, in particular in relation to best practices

 CANADA made a distinction between automaticity and predetermination of consequences

 Supported by AUSTRALIA, he opposed the loss of access to mechanisms as a result of a failure to meet the obligations under Article 3

 INDIA cautioned against the use of terms that are not contained in the Protocol, such as "AAUs," and said the JWG should not prejudge the outcome of the work undertaken by the contact group on mechanisms

 JAPAN questioned the utility of including the precautionary principle since it is a general principle that does not direct concrete action in non-compliance cases

 AUSTRALIA asked how the precautionary principle could assist Parties in achieving compliance

" INDIA, with CHINA, stressed the importance of including the notion of common but differentiated responsibilities in the principles section

 CANADA, with AUSTRALIA and the US, opposed the express inclusion of principles in the elements of a compliance framework as he said, the compliance process should ensure the implementation of the Protocol provisions rather than add new rules and principles

 The US, the EU and AUSTRALIA added that the Protocol principles should be reflected in the design of the compliance system itself

" AUSTRALIA stressed that Article 3

 INDIA said that Parties should adhere to the language in the Protocol and keep in mind work undertaken in other contact groups

 ZIMBABWE noted the need to identify different levels of initial actions appropriate for countries with different levels of development

 ZIMBABWE noted that communications and dialogue between policy makers and scientists needed to be two-directional

 UGANDA endorsed the need for awareness raising

<p>Replying to a question from FINLAND relating to the fact that some methodological guidelines for adaptation assessments are now over a decade old, Feenstra said methodologies should continue to be developed, but that this should not be used as a reason to delay adaptation assessments

 Responding to a question from the PHILIPPINES concerning the role of the private sector in adaptation studies, Feenstra noted that the private sector can play a part, but much work is needed to raise its understanding and awareness of climate change

<p>During the ensuing discussion, INDIA questioned the applicability of legislative measures to control abstraction from rivers in cases where water volumes fluctuate widely

 SWITZERLAND noted that precipitation in central Europe in winter has increased by 40%, with more intense rainfall rather than more days of precipitation, which has resulted in flooding

 ZIMBABWE noted the need for regional down-scaling of models to aid in assessing vulnerability and adaptation options

 FINLAND said high resolution climate models are not yet well developed

<p>Resuming discussions on the Co-Chairs’ draft conclusions, the G-77/CHINA proposed deleting a paragraph inviting the SBSTA Chair, with the assistance of the Secretariat, to provide additional reports on the outcome of the regional workshop, noting the limited time at COP-6 for negotiations

 MALAYSIA noted that the SBSTA Chair had the discretion to decide if and when to organize informal meetings

<p>On the impact of implementation of response measures, JAPAN, supported by the US but opposed by CHINA, stressed that non-Annex II Parties able to support developing countries should be encouraged to do so

 The G-77/CHINA, KUWAIT and VENEZUELA stressed the importance of technological development relating to fossil fuels for diversification of economies in oil exporting developing countries

 SWITZERLAND, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, supported the following consequences: a compliance action plan, restrictions on the use of mechanisms, and a compliance fund

 AUSTRALIA opposed financial penalties and the issuing of cautions

 BRAZIL, PERU, CHILE, COLOMBIA, NEW ZEALAND, COSTA RICA, BOLIVIA, AUSTRALIA, the US, JAPAN, URUGUAY, CANADA, NORWAY and the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP argued in favor of its inclusion, citing a variety of motivations and preconditions

 On the mandate of the enforcement branch, the G-77/CHINA stated the branch should only deal with Annex I Parties

 The EU, JAPAN and the US said the references to "Annex I Party" could be deleted since the articles falling into the scope of that branch only applied to Annex I Parties and since non-Annex I Parties were not submitted to host-country requirements under the CDM

 SAUDI ARABIA and the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, opposed by SAMOA and JAPAN, said Article 3

" INDIA, SAMOA and BRAZIL expressed concern at this new proposal

 On sources of information, the EU, US, CANADA and NEW ZEALAND opposed a suggestion by SAUDI ARABIA to delete reference to NGOs and IGOs

<p align="justify"><font size="3">On first order problems, GERMANY and the US, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, suggested including reference to this issue in the draft decision on Article 7 rather than in the guidelines under this article

 The US explained that annual reports include information on both inventories and the assigned amount and, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, suggested that first-order problems only refer to the former

<p align="justify"><font size="3">On "[initial] assigned amounts," the US and JAPAN stressed that the terminology was dependent on the outcome of the mechanisms group

 BRAZIL, supported by the G-77/CHINA, said the terminology was rather related to Protocol Article 3

 The US, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND and the EU supported 1 January 2007 as this deadline, while SAMOA preferred the year 2005 so as to allow a pre-first commitment period review and determination of eligibility to participate in the mechanisms

 The EU, US and JAPAN supported this proposal, while SAUDI ARABIA and VENEZULA opposed it

 CHINA and GHANA underscored a sectoral approach to technology transfer

 On POLAND´s suggestion to reflect the priorities of economies in transition in the text, BRAZIL said this was not explicitly reflected in UNFCCC Article 4

<p align="justify"><font size="3">On funding for the assessment, CANADA and the US preferred not specifying Annex II countries, stating that numerous sources of funding may be involved

<p align="justify"><font size="3">On the implementation of enabling environments, the G-77/ CHINA said that the actions of developing countries depend on the implementation of Annex I commitments

" BRAZIL, with CHINA and THAILAND, strongly objected to reference to the CDM and the continued attempts to link technology transfer under the UNFCCC to the Protocol

<p align="justify"><font size="3">On the definition of "forest," TUVALU supported the biome approach, and said it should be elaborated by COP-7

 The EU, the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, NORWAY and CHILE agreed, but said the approach is not yet mature and the definition in the Co-Chairs’ text will suffice for the time being

 The EU stressed the need for consistency and symmetry within all definitions, while CHINA said it would be premature to agree on definitions relevant to Protocol Article 3

<p align="justify"><font size="3">On additional activities during the first commitment period, the EU, TUVALU, CHINA, NORWAY and MALAYSIA, opposed by JAPAN, said these should not be pursued

 TUVALU and the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP requested deletion of text that would allow Parties to "elect" the activities under Article 3

 On additional activities during the second and subsequent commitment periods, the EU, NORWAY, TUVALU and MALAYSIA, opposed by JAPAN, said the COP should establish a list prior to the second commitment period

 Opposed by NEW ZEALAND and supported by INDIA, he added that, pending agreement of this issue in the LULUCF group, any reference to Article 3

 In the guidelines under Article 8, the G-77/CHINA suggested deleting Part III on the review of information on AA

 INDIA explained that AA are fixed amounts and therefore cannot be reviewed, however the information on additions and subtractions would be reviewed

 BRAZIL, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, then introduced a text for a new Part III <i>bis</i> that addresses the terminology "initial AA" and replaces it with "amounts that contribute to the compliance of a Party included in Annex I with the quantified emission limitation and reduction commitment under Article 3

 The US and AUSTRALIA underlined that there were four possible options

 AUSTRALIA and the US, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA and the EU, proposed deleting chapeau language on an assessment of demonstrable progress

 On a proposal by the G-77/ CHINA to delete Part III on the review of information on AA, the US said the guidelines should provide for review of information related to AA

 Noting the importance of environmental integrity, JAPAN highlighted the need for rules to operationalize the Protocol and mobilize the private sector

 FINLAND said the mechanisms must be transparent and reliable and not be a tool for printing "forged money" for environmental credits

<p align="justify"><font size="3">On the CDM, COSTA RICA, BOLIVIA and SENEGAL, opposed by IRELAND and AUSTRIA, favored including sinks in the CDM

 INDONESIA said sinks could be eligible if carbon sequestration is real and measurable

<p align="justify"><font size="3">NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY, AUSTRIA, HONDURAS and COSTA RICA said nuclear power should not be permitted within the CDM

 JAPAN said that developing countries’ judgment of what constitutes sustainable development should not be overruled by limiting the types of eligible activities under the CDM

 MOROCCO said the CDM should not be used as a channel for exporting obsolete technologies from North to South

 KENYA said though the benefits of land use activities are undeniable, including them in the CDM is likely to be counter-productive

 CHINA and INDIA stressed the need to avoid protectionist trade measures in the name of climate change action

 SINGAPORE and BRAZIL called for including text on an open international economic system and on parties not using trade measures that lead to arbitrary discrimination or constitute disguised trade restrictions

 AUSTRALIA supported a clear and concise roadmap, saying the detailed tools to implement it should be placed under thematic decisions

 BOLIVIA also supported the establishment of an international court of climate and environmental justice and democratic participation with world referenda on climate issues

 NORWAY emphasized the need for global emissions to peak at the earliest possible time and proposed that a review process be conducted regularly

<p class="textstory">Brazil, for the G-77/CHINA, identified the need for stronger language on using the Kyoto Protocol as the basis for Annex I MRV and compliance, and recalled the G-77/China’s proposal for a technical panel on comparability of developed countries’ mitigation efforts

 The G-77/CHINA stressed that commitments should be defined top down, reflect science, and be part of the formal outcome of the negotiations

 COLOMBIA, also speaking for Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Panama, Peru and Uruguay, expressed “great interest” in the proposal by AOSIS

 He emphasized that MRV for Annex I countries must be considered in tandem with international consultation and analysis for non-Annex I countries and, with CANADA, proposed a separate chapter on this

 AUSTRALIA expressed support for devoting a portion of the meeting to discussing MRV

 CHINA highlighted comparability as the core of sub-paragraph 1(b)(i) of the BAP, and said the same provisions on third party review, LULUCF and offsets should apply to Protocol parties and non-parties

 INDONESIA stressed MRV as a key element in the achievement of developed countries reduction objectives

 The PHILIPPINES supported a top-down approach to setting science-based targets, with the objective of not exceeding a 1

 NICARAGUA highlighted the importance of domestic reductions

 JAPAN, supported by many parties, suggested inviting submissions from parties on good practices and lessons learned, as input for the interim review

 The Gambia, for the G-77/CHINA, suggested requesting the Secretariat to compile and synthesize the outcomes and recommendations from the regional workshops held so far, together with the implementation of these outcomes and recommendations

 NEPAL called for extending the work programme for at least five years

 MALAWI questioned why no regional workshop had been organized in Africa and the Secretariat responded that this was due to lack of funds

 CHINA emphasized that the current pledges are not sufficient

<p class="textstory">COLOMBIA, supported by GRENADA, the PHILIPPINES and BARBADOS, called for a joint discussion of emission reductions by all Annex I countries

 CHINA opposed any attempt to merge the two AWGs but said they could go along with the proposal by Colombia if the discussion was strictly limited to discussion of Annex I emission reductions and was compatible with the respective mandates of the AWGs

 BOLIVIA, VENEZUELA, SINGAPORE, SUDAN and BRAZIL opposed “broader discussions

” AUSTRALIA emphasized that no single group of countries is able to deliver the level of ambition necessary to address climate change and that if ambitions were to be hardened down to specific numbers, a broader discussion would be the next step

 ARGENTINA said that a joint discussion is premature

 INDIA opposed discussions of developing countries' emission reductions

 JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the US noted that, although there are portions of the text that could be acceptable as a basis for discussions, the text contains some elements that will take parties back to previous discussions and disagreements

 JAPAN, supported by the US and others, but opposed by Tanzania, for the G-77/CHINA, proposed inviting presentations from the UN Development Programme and from any other interested party or organization, on experiences of monitoring and evaluation within countries

 Bangladesh, for the G-77/CHINA, noted the need to strike an appropriate balance bearing in mind that the process is party-driven

 AUSTRALIA supported the proposal for a separate thematic chapter on MRV

 BRAZIL supported having two different sections on mitigation by Annex I and non-Annex I countries

<p class="textstory">The PHILIPPINES said the AWG-LCA was not the right forum for discussing non-Annex I national communications and THAILAND noted that the revision of the non-Annex I reporting guidelines should be done by the SBI

 PAKISTAN suggested different cycles for full national communications, with different cycles for different countries

 CHILE, also speaking for Colombia and Costa Rica, supported a technical review of national communications, with a greater focus on GHG inventories, as well as a procedure for recording NAMAs and their effect on countries’ emissions

 Regarding the NAMA review process, CHILE said developing countries should be supported to carry out the MRV preparatory phase, which would include establishment of a standardized process and common institutional framework with clearly defined guidelines specifying the process for the in-depth review

 MONGOLIA identified the need to update guidelines for national communications

 KYRGYZSTAN, also speaking for Tajikistan, Bhutan and Nepal, called for more attention to landlocked mountainous developing countries

<p class="textstory">The Philippines, for the G-77/CHINA, suggested building on existing mechanisms or guidelines, such as national communications, and applying these, rather than establishing new ones

 AUSTRALIA supported using national communications for MRV and said they could be improved, including by requiring more frequent reporting and establishing uniform indicators, in order to ensure that they are an effective way of reporting support

 JAPAN emphasized that Annex I parties already undertake robust and rigorous MRV under existing national communications guidelines, and that information on the Convention’s financial mechanisms is also submitted to the SBI

 On the elements for an MRV framework, CHINA suggested specific support goals including finance, capacity building and technology transfer, and identified the need for guidelines for the provision of new and additional finance

 INDIA emphasized the need for a set of common guidelines on what constitutes climate change financing and verification of support by a third party

 Recognizing the importance of the issue for AOSIS, NORWAY said the proposal to address loss and damage raises many questions but that his country is open to discussing them

<p class="textstory">SAUDI ARABIA, supported by ALGERIA, stressed the need to address the impacts of response measures in the context of adaptation, highlighting that in Copenhagen, political leaders, including those from AOSIS and the LDCs, agreed to such an approach

 BARBADOS, supported by GRENADA and COSTA RICA, stressed that the text on adaptation should not address response measures, highlighting that “patients suffering from a common cold should receive a different kind of attention than those with a serious illness

<p class="textstory">On institutional arrangements, CANADA said “function should come before form,” highlighting a country-driven approach that attends to the most vulnerable and promotes integration of adaptation into national strategies, including development strategies

 AUSTRALIA highlighted that the functions of institutional arrangements should include a focus on cooperation, shared information, trend and gap analyses, technical advice and capacity building

 With the US, AUSTRALIA said that matching of action and support is best discussed in the context of finance

 TURKEY suggested that institutional structures should act as a bridge to financial mechanisms, highlighted the need for loss and damage mechanisms and stressed prioritization of early warning systems

 The PHILIPPINES and TIMOR-LESTE supported the creation of an adaptation committee and a fund under the Convention, with the PHILIPPINES indicating that matching action with support should be clear, transparent, objective, predictable and country-driven

 Lamenting that existing structures are disregarded in current discussions, and suggesting that a newly created fund will take a long time to mature, PAKISTAN urged making the AF deliver and said there are “no legal issues that cannot be overcome

<p class="textstory">Lamenting that mitigation and adaptation have not been treated equally due to the lack of a specific adaptation body under the UNFCCC, CHINA supported the creation of an adaptation committee that, <em>inter alia</em>: assesses adaptation needs of developing countries; formulates guidance; develops technical criteria; and facilitates the implementation of programmes

 Emphasizing that the issue of response measures has been dealt with under mitigation, JAPAN urged avoiding duplication of efforts

<p class="textstory">Stressing the need for a more holistic approach to adaptation, BOLIVIA emphasized that developing countries cannot continuously adapt and urged developed countries to start adapting their way of life

 AFGHANISTAN and TAJIKISTAN proposed special consideration for mountainous countries

 GRENADA emphasized that there is no need for a new definition of vulnerability as the BAP already contains a definition

 PAKISTAN expressed disagreement with the notion of most vulnerable countries as defined in many documents, saying it is inconsistent with the UNFCCC, and urged a science-based category

 PERU called for adaptation to be integrated into existing national plans and called for the use of tools from the Nairobi work programme

 EGYPT highlighted the need for an oversight body for enhanced coordination on adaptation and a compliance board

<p class="textstory">South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, expressed willingness to engage in discussions on the important matter

<p class="textstory">Describing offsetting as “a good deal for the atmosphere,” the EU, with NORWAY, proposed a technical workshop to quantify the impact of the different mechanisms

 VENEZUELA, with the PHILIPPINES, called for a focus on environmental integrity at the workshop and, with INDONESIA, for a top-down rather than a bottom-up approach to aggregate emissions

 BRAZIL emphasized that the workshop should address supplementarity, saying that if the current level of ambition is maintained and the use of mechanisms scaled up, then most of the emission reduction efforts would be transferred to developing countries

<p class="textstory"><strong>OTHER ISSUES (AWG-KP): </strong>In the afternoon contact group on LULUCF, Brazil, for the G-77/CHINA, outlined the G-77/China’s proposal on constructing reference levels

 Noting problems of accurate, transparent and verifiable accounting of forest management activities, TUVALU underscored that there are other accounting options

<p class="textstory">Highlighting the challenge of identifying the impact of policy on reference levels, the G-77/CHINA proposed a cap on forest management that is fixed for all parties, noting that there was not yet agreement on a specific percentage

 AUSTRALIA said that provisional application might be problematic due to domestic constraints

 JAPAN highlighted: public and private partnerships as key to enabling technology development; strict protection of intellectual property rights (IPRs); and a TEC serving as a high-level advisory body

<p class="textstory">The US, supported by AUSTRALIA, said the TEC and centers and networks should have equal standing and they would report to the COP through the SBSTA

<p class="textstory">Argentina, for the G-77/CHINA, said the TEC should be a stand-alone body and report to the COP

 INDIA said the technology mechanism should support knowledge management and pilot new technology, and facilitate cooperation for diffusion of technologies

 CHINA, supported by SOUTH AFRICA, emphasized that the TEC should be a strong entity with a role in guidance, setting up programmes and raising financial support, and said it should be independent and report directly to the COP

<p class="textstory">Emphasizing that current mechanisms for technology development and transfer are inadequate, TURKEY called for: an effective, dynamic and transparent mechanism; regular and effective information exchange of its bodies; balanced representation of developing and developed countries; consideration of different national circumstances; and cooperation of the mechanism’s bodies with the SBs and relevant bodies outside the UNFCCC

 PAKISTAN suggested that the TEC and TCN be under the authority of the COP, seek to enhance cooperation and remove barriers, and that the TEC should be a stand-alone body, reporting directly to the COP

 Suggesting that the “green revolution” provides important lessons on the role of technology transfer in agriculture and that it has contributed to increases in food production, but did not protect small farmers and respect the role of indigenous and local knowledge, GUATEMALA urged considering the most vulnerable sectors of the society

 NICARAGUA said the focus must be on technologies that are useful, clean and socially appropriate, and technologies should be controlled by the public domain rather than by private monopolies

<p class="textstory">The US, with TURKEY, called for a separate chapter on MRV

 TURKEY said developed countries should report according to existing guidelines for Annex I countries

<p class="textstory">Brazil, for the G-77/CHINA, called for a strong compliance mechanism and the application of the Protocol rules to Annex I countries, including LULUCF accounting

<p class="textstory">Lamenting that discussions focused on reporting, SINGAPORE suggested that MRV should contribute to ensuring Annex I countries’ compliance and urged that the measuring rules for all Annex I countries are comparable and coherent in order to provide a clear picture of emission reductions

 AUSTRALIA said MRV should be regular and transparent and include information on targets, reductions, methodologies, the use of offsets and the provision or receipt of technical, financial and capacity building support

 BOLIVIA underscored the need for Annex I countries to report on the relative contributions of domestic efforts and market mechanisms to meeting their targets and noted the importance of financial penalties or target adjustments in cases of non-compliance

 The PHILIPPINES underscored that MRV is “meaningless without compliance” and called for a technical panel on comparability

<p class="textstory">Brazil, for the G-77/CHINA, noted preference for a net-net approach, with a cap on the use of LULUCF

 TUVALU said the impacts should be shown with absolute tonnage rather than percentages and also requested clarity on the assumptions used in the presentation

 UGANDA asked whether countries’ forest management methods and the nature of forests in each country were taken into consideration

 Noting that countries have said they will adjust their targets depending on the rules adopted, TUVALU highlighted the importance of ensuring that LULUCF rules are the tightest possible to meet the environmental integrity requirements and not give countries too much flexibility to make adjustments to their pledges

 AUSTRALIA said her country’s pledge envisages the use of LULUCF “as fully as possible” and objected to setting a cap on the use of LULUCF

 BRAZIL urged Annex I countries to accept the mandatory application of Protocol Article 3

 Tanzania, for the G-77/CHINA, opposed a reference to the private sector addressing a range of priority needs, stressing lack of evidence of the private sector’s contribution to capacity building

<p class="textstory">CANADA and AUSTRALIA questioned the need for extra informal consultations on the issue

 SAUDI ARABIA, noting the number of substantive issues to be addressed, with QATAR, INDIA and CHINA, said that extra time would be “extremely useful

” AUSTRALIA proposed assessing the need for a second informal meeting after the first one

 INDIA said the focus should be on impacts affecting all developing countries, but that consideration could initially focus on the poorest and most vulnerable countries

 CHINA stressed that “poorest and least able” is not a concept included in the Convention

<p class="textstory">PAPUA NEW GUINEA stressed the need for climate compatible development plans, noting that many deforestation drivers come from outside the forest

 AUSTRALIA said the registry for actions seeking support, as specified under the Copenhagen Accord, should be made operational

 JAPAN called for streamlined, biennial national communications with information on relevant mitigation actions and periodic full national communications, with expert analysis

<p class="textstory"> CHINA identified the SBI, not the AWG-LCA, as the appropriate body to consider reporting guidelines, and said undertaking planning activities should not be a pre-condition for seeking financial support for NAMAs

 PAKISTAN indicated that unsupported mitigation actions are distinct from NAMAs and that efforts could be made to strengthen reporting guidelines

 INDONESIA said non-Annex I countries should communicate information on supported NAMAs through their national communications, and that the SBI should establish the guidelines for ICA

 EGYPT said support should focus not only on planning and elaboration of NAMAs, but also on implementation, and stressed that the revision of reporting guidelines should not lead to unification of guidelines for both Annex I and non-Annex I countries

 The PHILIPPINES stressed effective implementation of Convention Article 4

 CHILE highlighted reporting on financial and technical support received, in addition to the implementation of NAMAs

 BOLIVIA underscored that emission reductions from NAMAs should not be used to offset developed country emission reductions and noted that guidelines for national communications should be addressed under the SBSTA

 JAMAICA underscored that actions should be voluntary and that guidance software could be developed to assist parties

 SINGAPORE said an ICA system should be: technical, not political or politicized; party-driven; based on technical expertise including that of parties concerned, and on the objectives established by the concerned developing country; and carried out in the spirit of mutual respect

 CHINA noted little benefit from the carryover of surplus AAUs

 BRAZIL and INDIA supported capping carryover of AAUs

 NORWAY, ICELAND, NEW ZEALAND, SWITZERLAND, UGANDA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION agreed that a workshop to explore options would be useful

 CHINA, with BRAZIL, suggested only exempting countries with economies in transition, while the EU cautioned against “discrimination of our Member States

 GUATEMALA said national communications are too narrow and suggested the use of existing expert forums like the UN Conference on Trade and Development

 SWITZERLAND cautioned against distributing the tables too widely

 SOUTH AFRICA, with the Gambia, for the AFRICAN GROUP, the FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA, NORWAY and others supported making the tables widely available

 NORWAY added that it should be made clear that the numbers are illustrative and provisional and ICELAND cautioned against attaching too much importance to the numbers

 With JAPAN, he opposed wider distribution of the tables

 SWITZERLAND, stressing his support for full transparency, proposed that all materials, including parties’ presentations, should be published by the Secretariat in a “dedicated space” on their website

 ZAMBIA suggested that the tables should indicate those parties that are exceeding or have exceeded their first commitment period targets

 JAPAN and AUSTRALIA supported discussing the actions of all parties, not just of Annex B parties

 BOLIVIA made a presentation showing: Annex B parties’ individual reduction pledges; Annex B parties’ aggregate reductions; and Annex B parties’ aggregate reductions taking into account surplus AAUs and LULUCF credits
