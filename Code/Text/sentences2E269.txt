 Informal consultations on this issue focused on whether to set out a process, which the EU and others supported, but SAUDI ARABIA and a number of other developing countries opposed.
On objectives of the work programme, Samoa, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, supported by JAPAN and opposed by the US, proposed text including reference to the most vulnerable and to Decision 1/CP.10.
SWITZERLAND, with NORWAY, called instead for specific reference to SBSTA ef bf bds work under Decision 1/CP.10.
The US, opposed by the EU, suggested referring to climate risks, impacts and vulnerability instead of to climate change.
 On the Submission of second and, where appropriate, third national communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.9), the Co-Chairs of the informal consultations, Soobaraj Nayroo Sok Appadu (Mauritius) and Anders Turesson (Sweden), reported agreement.
Compromise text apparently aimed at accommodating requests by AOSIS and others for a UNFCCC follow-up on the Mauritius Strategy, was withdrawn.
In discussions convened in a small drafting group, the US opposed suggested language on an ongoing process, preferring shorter text taking note of the Mauritius Strategy.
AOSIS and the EU opposed a shorter text.
  Contact group Co-Chairs Emily Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya) and Jozef Buys (Belgium) reported that, despite some progress, delegates had been unable to reach agreement.
The EU, CANADA, and others offered support for the Chair ef bf bds proposals.
The EU and G-77/CHINA supported the proposed budget.
However, the US suggested reducing the Convention budget by US$2 million, while Japan proposed reducing the overall budget by US$3 million.
No progress was made, with the EU and CANADA proposing to have such a forum, opposed by G-77/CHINA, the US, and AUSTRALIA.
After lengthy discussions, delegates accepted a proposal by SAUDI ARABIA, seconded by the US, to remove reference to a forum.
