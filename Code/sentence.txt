\r\nThe INC held its ninth session from 7-18 February 1994, in Geneva.
In discussions on\r\nmatters relating to commitments, delegates examined methodologies for\r\ncalculations/inventories of emissions and removal of greenhouse gases, the first review\r\nof information communicated by Annex I parties, the role of the subsidiary bodies\r\nestablished by the Convention, and criteria for joint implementation.
Delegates also\r\nreviewed the adequacy of commitments.
The need for broader action beyond the year\r\n2000 on the commitments in Article 4.2(a) and (b) was considered, based on the\r\nunderstanding that the provisions of this article refer to the present decade.\r\n\r\nIn its discussions on matters relating to the financial mechanism and technical and\r\nfinancial support to developing country Parties, the Committee chose to focus on the\r\nimplementation of Article 11.
It was agreed that only developing countries that are\r\nParties to the Convention would be eligible to receive funding upon entry into force of\r\nthe Convention.
There was general support for a cost-effective arrangement for the\r\nPermanent Secretariat that would encourage collaboration with other secretariats.
The\r\nquestion of the location of the Permanent Secretariat was not resolved, but it was\r\nagreed that the Permanent Secretariat will start operating on 1 January 1996, and, in\r\nthe interest of continuity, will be organized along the same lines as the Interim\r\nSecretariat.\r\n\r\n \n\nvar _gaq = _gaq || [];\n_gaq.push([\'_setAccount\', \'UA-2638113-2\']);\n_gaq.push([\'_trackPageview\']);\n(function() {\n var ga = document.createElement(\'script\');\n ga.src = (\'https:\' == document.location.protocol ?

\r\nThe 49th session of the UN General Assembly considered the Framework Convention\r\non Climate Change from 19-21 October 1994.
During the debate, the Chair of the\r\nINC/FCCC, Amb.
Ra\xef\xbf\xbdl Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina), noted that although much progress\r\nhas been made, additional measures may be needed.
The participation of developing\r\ncountries in the Convention needs to be clearer " the only quantitative commitment is\r\nthat the developed countries must reduce emissions to 1990 levels.\r\n\r\nIn other statements, Antigua and Barbuda, on behalf of the Caribbean Community,\r\nsaid industrialized countries should take significant steps to reduce emissions of carbon\r\ndioxide and other greenhouse gases.
These concerns are adequately addressed by the\r\nAOSIS draft protocol on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
He urged that the\r\ndebate on the AOSIS draft protocol begin at INC-11, with its subsequent adoption at\r\nthe first COP.
Austria, supported by New Zealand, stated that commitments must be\r\nstrengthened and that a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions after the year 2000 is\r\nnecessary to achieve the goals of the Convention.\r\n\r\nAlgeria, on behalf of the G-77, urged parties to the Convention not to go beyond the\r\noriginal mandate.
Distinct categories of parties should have distinct responsibilities and\r\nany attempt to undermine this principle through innovative concepts, such as joint\r\nimplementation, would have negative repercussions.
China said that it did not approve\r\nof any attempt to make developing countries accept concrete restrictive targets through\r\namending the Convention or negotiating new protocols.
India said there is still a lack\r\nof clarity on several concepts in the Convention, including full incremental costs, joint\r\nimplementation and transfer of technology.
While India recognized the need to address\r\nreduction of greenhouse gases beyond the year 2000, he did not believe that this is the\r\ntime to strengthen commitments, since INC negotiations on a new protocol could\r\ndistract from establishing a fundamental basis to implement the existing Convention.\r\n\r\n \n\nvar _gaq = _gaq || [];\n_gaq.push([\'_setAccount\', \'UA-2638113-2\']);\n_gaq.push([\'_trackPageview\']);\n(function() {\n var ga = document.createElement(\'script\');\n ga.src = (\'https:\' == document.location.protocol ?

\r\nSince the adoption of the Convention, the INC has met five more times to consider the\r\nfollowing items: matters relating to commitments; matters relating to arrangements for\r\nthe financial mechanism and for technical and financial support to developing\r\ncountries; procedural and legal matters; and institutional matters.
During these INC\r\nsessions, scientific work was done to improve the methodologies for measuring\r\nemissions from various sources, but the larger scientific problem is choosing the best\r\nmethodology to estimate the removal of carbon dioxide by "sinks," namely oceans and\r\nforests.
The other major task before negotiators has been to work on the difficult issue\r\nof financial support for implementation, particularly for developing country Parties\r\nwho will require "new and additional resources" to obtain data and implement energy-\r\nefficient technologies and other necessary measures.\r\n\r\n \n\nvar _gaq = _gaq || [];\n_gaq.push([\'_setAccount\', \'UA-2638113-2\']);\n_gaq.push([\'_trackPageview\']);\n(function() {\n var ga = document.createElement(\'script\');\n ga.src = (\'https:\' == document.location.protocol ?

\r\nThe tenth session of the INC was held from 22 August - 2 September 1994, in\r\nGeneva.
The Committee agreed on the mechanisms for the first review of information\r\ncommunicated by Annex I Parties.
Some countries expressed the need for a cautious\r\napproach to the review of the adequacy of commitments, since the scientific and\r\ntechnical assessments upon which existing commitments are based were essentially\r\nunchanged.
Some countries also felt that the first meeting of the COP would be a good\r\noccasion to make progress on the elaboration of additional commitments.
On the issue\r\nof joint implementation, comments were invited on: objectives, criteria and operational\r\nguidelines, functions and institutional arrangements, and communication and review\r\nand early experiences.\r\n\r\nOn matters related to the financial mechanism, countries agreed to stage-by-stage\r\nfunding modality for adaptation measures.
The temporary arrangements between the\r\nCommittee and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) was also adopted.
On agreed\r\nfull incremental costs, the Committee concluded that this issue was complex and that\r\nfurther discussion was needed.
Delegates also concluded that the concept should be\r\nflexible and applied on a case-by-case basis.
The Interim Secretariat was requested to\r\nprepare a paper on transfer of technology and delegations were invited to submit their\r\nviews on this issue.
On the subject of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and\r\nTechnological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI),\r\nthe provisional recommendation to the COP is that the SBSTA will be the link\r\nbetween the scientific and technical assessments and the information provided by\r\ninternational bodies and the policy-oriented needs of the COP.
The SBI will develop\r\nrecommendations to assist the COP in its assessment and review of the implementation\r\nof the Convention.\r\n\r\nWith regard to procedural and legal matters, the Committee decided to continue its\r\nconsideration of the draft Rules of Procedure at its eleventh session.
On institutional\r\nmatters, a contact group composed of five members of the Bureau, one from each of\r\nthe five regional groups, was established to consider the various offers of governments\r\nand UN agencies to host the Permanent Secretariat for the Convention and make\r\nrecommendations for the consideration of the Committee at its eleventh session.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to INC-10, Trinidad and Tobago, on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island\r\nStates (AOSIS), submitted a draft protocol to the Interim Secretariat.

\r\nOn 11 December 1990, the 45th session of the UN General Assembly adopted a\r\nresolution that established the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a\r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (INC/FCCC).
Supported by UNEP and\r\nWMO, the mandate of the INC/FCCC was to prepare an effective framework\r\nconvention on climate change.
The INC held five sessions between February 1991 and\r\nMay 1992.
During these meetings, participants from over 150 states discussed the\r\ndifficult and contentious issues of binding commitments, targets and timetables for the\r\nreduction of carbon dioxide emissions, financial mechanisms, technology transfer, and\r\n"common but differentiated" responsibilities of developed and developing countries.\r\nThe INC sought to achieve a consensus that could be supported by a broad majority,\r\nrather than drafting a treaty that dealt with specific policies that might limit\r\nparticipation.\r\n\r\n \n\nvar _gaq = _gaq || [];\n_gaq.push([\'_setAccount\', \'UA-2638113-2\']);\n_gaq.push([\'_trackPageview\']);\n(function() {\n var ga = document.createElement(\'script\');\n ga.src = (\'https:\' == document.location.protocol ?

\r\nIncreasing scientific evidence about the possibility of global climate change in the\r\n1980s led to a growing awareness that human activities have been contributing to\r\nsubstantial increases in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.
Concerned\r\nthat anthropogenic increases of emissions enhance the natural greenhouse effect and\r\nwould result, on average, in an additional warming of the Earth"s surface, the World\r\nMeteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme\r\n(UNEP) established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1988.\r\nThe Panel focused on: assessing scientific information related to the various aspects of\r\nclimate change; evaluating the environmental and socio-economic impacts of climate\r\nchange; and formulating response strategies for the management of global climate\r\nchange.

With regard to Annex\r\nI communications, questions were raised as to whether individual Parties" national\r\ncommunications should be referred to specifically in any synthesis or compilation or\r\nwhether the summary should refer to the collective results of national communications.\r\n\r\n \n\nvar _gaq = _gaq || [];\n_gaq.push([\'_setAccount\', \'UA-2638113-2\']);\n_gaq.push([\'_trackPageview\']);\n(function() {\n var ga = document.createElement(\'script\');\n ga.src = (\'https:\' == document.location.protocol ?

\r\nOn matters related to the financial mechanism, countries agreed to stage-by-stage\r\nfunding modality for adaptation measures.
The temporary arrangements between the\r\nCommittee and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) was also adopted.
On agreed\r\nfull incremental costs, the Committee concluded that this issue was complex and that\r\nfurther discussion was needed.
Delegates also concluded that the concept should be\r\nflexible and applied on a case-by-case basis.
The Interim Secretariat was requested to\r\nprepare a paper on transfer of technology and delegations were invited to submit their\r\nviews on this issue.
On the subject of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and\r\nTechnological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI),\r\nthe provisional recommendation to the COP is that the SBSTA will be the link\r\nbetween the scientific and technical assessments and the information provided by\r\ninternational bodies and the policy-oriented needs of the COP.
The SBI will develop\r\nrecommendations to assist the COP in its assessment and review of the implementation\r\nof the Convention.\r\n\r\nWith regard to procedural and legal matters, the Committee decided to continue its\r\nconsideration of the draft Rules of Procedure at its eleventh session.
On institutional\r\nmatters, a contact group composed of five members of the Bureau, one from each of\r\nthe five regional groups, was established to consider the various offers of governments\r\nand UN agencies to host the Permanent Secretariat for the Convention and make\r\nrecommendations for the consideration of the Committee at its eleventh session.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to INC-10, Trinidad and Tobago, on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island\r\nStates (AOSIS), submitted a draft protocol to the Interim Secretariat.
This protocol,\r\nwhich was distributed to other Parties, calls for a reduction of emissions of greenhouse\r\ngases by "at least 20% by the year 2005.
