 The G-77/CHINA, supported by BRAZIL, SAUDI ARABIA and BURKINA FASO, said there was no group support for an item on voluntary commitments and, with CHINA, called for transparency in drafting high-level statements

 The G-77/CHINA said the joint cooperation mechanisms bring about technical, political and other new uncertainties that must be settled

 The G-77/CHINA expressed alarm at interpretations of the CDM as a clean production mechanism or a global carbon fund

 The G-77/CHINA, supported by the PHILIPPINES, SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA, called upon SBSTA to clarify methodological issues before substantive issues are discussed

 The G-77/CHINA presented an initial list of issues to address, and stressed consideration of fundamental issues before timing and schedules of work

 The US suggested basing group discussions on both the G-77/China questions and the Co-Chairs' draft proposed schedule

 The G-77/CHINA commented that "rights" are included in the literature on domestic common property resource trading schemes and in the FCCC regarding the right to develop

 <p>INDIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, expressed satisfaction regarding the deliberations related to the mechanisms

 Although Parties expressed views that were compiled into a Chair's draft paper, the contact group was unable to finish its work on the agenda item at a third meeting due to non-attendance by official representation from the G-77/China

 INDONESIA reported that the G-77/China felt it was premature to try to decide the organization of work until after work on mechanisms and review of adequacy of commitments under FCCC 4

 <p>INDONESIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, said that all mechanisms must be examined on the basis of equity, sustainable development and the objective of the Convention

 <p>The G-77/China told the SBI that COP-4's second review must respect the FCCC mandate and not be distracted by extraneous matters such as consideration of new commitments for non-Annex I Parties

<p>INDONESIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, said that all mechanisms must be examined on the basis of equity, sustainable development and the objective of the Convention

<p>The G-77/China told the SBI that COP-4's second review must respect the FCCC mandate and not be distracted by extraneous matters such as consideration of new commitments for non-Annex I Parties

 In response, the G-77/China distanced itself from any attempts to draw developing countries into agreeing to anything that could be interpreted as new commitments

 After joint SBI/SBSTA consideration and extensive contact group debates on the flexibility mechanisms, delegates could only agree to a compilation document containing proposals from the G-77/China, the EU and the US

 <p>INDONESIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, said this issue had been deliberated at length, but no consensus had been reached

 He said voluntary commitments would create a new category of Parties under the FCCC and could destroy the unity of the G-77/China

 QATAR, TOGO, CUBA, THAILAND and UGANDA also supported the G-77/China

 Some Parties had insisted on equal representation of Annex I and non-Annex I Parties, but the G-77/CHINA said membership should be based on equitable geographic representation

<p>INDONESIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, said this issue had been deliberated at length, but no consensus had been reached

 <p>The G-77/CHINA, supported by several developing countries, observed that AIJ is separate from the mechanisms arising from the Protocol

<p>The G-77/CHINA, supported by several developing countries, observed that AIJ is separate from the mechanisms arising from the Protocol

 The G-77/CHINA reiterated the need for the flexibility mechanisms to proceed step-by-step

 The G-77/CHINA and several developing countries said: the issue is important to the Convention; a clear decision defining new commitments needs to be reached; and developed countries were shirking their responsibilities in this matter

 <p>The G-77/CHINA said without practical technical know-how, technology transfer would be impossible

 The US opposed the G-77/China proposal for a new technology transfer mechanism as it would be difficult to agree on its terms of reference

 Other Parties, including G-77/CHINA, called for more time to consider the volume of documentation

<p>The G-77/CHINA said without practical technical know-how, technology transfer would be impossible

 The G-77/CHINA suggested requesting the Annex I Parties to include information on possible impacts in their national communications

 The G-77/CHINA, after considering comments to their initial proposal presented in the previous meeting, outlined two new proposals on the substantive issues, namely: the status of and guidance to the Global Environmental Facility

 Developing country Parties insisted that a draft decision provided by the G-77/CHINA provide the basis for the group's deliberation

 Three draft decisions proposed by the US, G-77/China and the EU (FCCC/CP/1998/MISC

 The G-77/China proposal focused on identifying means of linking the issues and providing an interface between the providers of technology and the recipients

” There was consensus on the capacity building section of the G-77/China proposal, which called for efforts to enhance endogenous capacities and provide enabling environments

 <p>The Chair noted the emerging consensus on: the need for progress; the terms outlined in the capacity building section of the G-77/China proposal; and the need for dialogue consultations and information exchange

 He expressed concern that some developed countries have underestimated the degree of significance the G-77/China places on the issue, perhaps to the point of halting negotiations unless the COP takes a decision

<p>The Chair noted the emerging consensus on: the need for progress; the terms outlined in the capacity building section of the G-77/China proposal; and the need for dialogue consultations and information exchange

 <p>On the reports of the subsidiary bodies, G-77/CHINA reiterated the importance of technology transfer to developing countries and proposed the establishment of a technology transfer mechanism

 While the EU supported the overall framework of the G-77/China draft decision, with the US, he said it should not include funding for stage II and III processes

 <p>The contact group on technology met on Friday and Saturday to discuss the proposals for a draft decision put forward by the US, EU and G-77/China

 The G-77/CHINA presented the principles of the proposed technology transfer mechanism, drawing upon the US and EU proposals

 A discussion of four draft proposals, presented by AUSTRALIA, the EU, G-77/CHINA and the US, dominated discussion

 Debate concerned procedural issues on how to address the texts, with the G-77/CHINA indicating its reluctance to consider a compilation text prepared by the Co-Chairs

 After extensive debate, the G-77/CHINA proposed, with the EU and NEW ZEALAND, a reworked text as a negotiating document

 The US, with the eventual support of G-77/CHINA, rejected the compilation document and called on the four draft decisions to be presented in their entirety to the SBI

<p>The contact group on technology met on Friday and Saturday to discuss the proposals for a draft decision put forward by the US, EU and G-77/China

 The draft decision included an annex with a list of functions for a possible process defined by the G-77/China and a preliminary list of issues and questions

 The G-77/CHINA submitted a proposed work programme containing an extensive list of issues, embodying a “step-by-step” approach and prioritizing the CDM

 The EU said the G-77/China draft programme lacked inter alia, a clear timeline, deadlines and allocation of work to different bodies

 Some G-77/CHINA delegates expressed increasing discomfort with the continuing focus on voluntary commitments presented in the BuenosAyres newspaper

 The G-77/CHINA favored retaining reference to a technology transfer mechanism and considering the paragraph along with a bracketed reference in the Annex, which required consideration of appropriate mechanisms for technology transfer with the UNFCCC

” The G-77/CHINA favored “technology transfer mechanism,” but indicated willingness to accept “meaningful and effective action” if brackets were removed from the Annex

 After some debate, the Chair invited the EU, the US and the G-77/China to discuss the issue informally

 The G-77/CHINA said there were compromises even in the unbracketed text

 The G-77/CHINA proposed bracketing a paragraph in the Annex that notes many Annex I Parties will not reduce GHGs to 1990 levels

 The G-77/CHINA bracketed the entire text

 In addition to the G-77/China proposal submitted earlier, draft work programmes were submitted by AUSTRALIA (on behalf of CANADA, ICELAND, NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and the US), JAPAN, SWITZERLAND and the Co-Chairs

 <p>At the request of G-77/CHINA, the Parties reconvened later to discuss the draft as amended by the Co-Chairs

 <p>A number of countries, including the EU, GAMBIA, JAPAN, SWEDEN, SYRIA, CROATIA, NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, EGYPT, NEPAL SPAIN, GHANA and the G-77/CHINA, stressed that: active leadership to prevent global warming must come from developed country Parties; domestic action must provide the main means for meeting commitments to combat climate change; and noted that flexibility mechanisms were supplemental and their use must be subject to strict rules of accountability and compliance

 The G-77/CHINA said their participation in mitigating climate change depends on the effective implementation of developed country Party commitments in the field of technology transfer and financial resources

 <p>GHANA said the challenges of climate change mitigation and adaptation present an additional burden to developing countries and with the CARICOM states, ICELAND, AUSTRALIA, the US, SAUDI ARABIA, NEW ZEALAND and the G-77/CHINA called for elaboration of mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol

 The CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES stressed the importance of sinks and supported the G-77/China proposal to prioritize the CDM and operationalize it by 1 January 2000

 The G-77/CHINA called for a decision on compliance at COP-4

<p>On Friday, 6 November, the contact group discussed a draft decision presented by the G-77/China (FCCC/CP/1998/MISC

 The G-77/CHINA said this proposal did not adequately meet the needs of developing country Parties

 The G-77/CHINA said: the issue is important to the Convention; a clear decision defining new commitments should be reached; and developed countries were shirking their responsibilities in this matter

 Developing country Parties insisted that a G-77/CHINA draft decision provide the basis for the deliberations

 A discussion of four draft proposals, presented by AUSTRALIA, the EU, the G-77/CHINA and the US, dominated the deliberations

 Debate concerned procedural issues on how to address the texts, with the G-77/CHINA indicating reluctance to consider a compilation text prepared by the Co-Chairs

 The EU and a group of Annex I Parties, including Australia, Canada, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway, the Russian Federation and the US ("Umbrella Group") distributed draft decisions and discussion documents

 Other Parties, including the G-77/CHINA, called for more time to consider the volume of documentation

<p>On Friday, 6 November, the G-77/CHINA stressed the need for a clear section in the work programme devoted to the nature and scope of the mechanisms to facilitate comparison

<p>On Monday, 9 November, the G-77/CHINA submitted a proposed work programme containing an extensive list of issues, embodying a "step-by-step" approach and prioritizing the CDM

<p>A number of speakers, including the EU, THE GAMBIA, JAPAN, SWEDEN, SYRIA, CROATIA, NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, EGYPT, NEPAL, SPAIN, GHANA and the G-77/CHINA, stressed that: active leadership to prevent global warming must come from developed country Parties; domestic action must provide the main means for meeting commitments to combat climate change; and flexibility mechanisms were supplemental and their use must be subject to strict rules of accountability and compliance

<p>GHANA said the challenges of climate change mitigation and adaptation present an additional burden to developing countries and with the CARICOM States, ICELAND, AUSTRALIA, the US, SAUDI ARABIA, NEW ZEALAND and the G-77/CHINA, called for elaboration of mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol

 The first was the much anticipated decision by the host country to break ranks with most of its partners in the G-77/China and signal its willingness to undertake a binding commitment at COP-5 to abate its greenhouse gas emissions

<p>it takes two to tango: The United States’ decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol after Argentina stepped out from the ranks of the G-77/China to take on a binding commitment must be seen in the context of one of the first debates of COP-4 – one that touched on a fault line running through the entire UNFCCC since 1995 when the G-77/China was fractured by a decision to establish the Berlin Mandate

 COP President Maria Julia Alsogaray responded to G-77/China opposition by striking the item off the agenda and suggesting that informal consultations between interested countries proceed

 As the host country and close US ally, Argentina was perfectly situated to break from the ranks of the G-77/China and both facilitate and accelerate an evolution in the UNFCCC process, which has been paralleled by growing interest in the developing world in the CDM

<p>One of the architects of the Kyoto Protocol has suggested that the language of "voluntary commitments" may not survive because the terminology has become has become tainted by the contentious debate between the Umbrella Group (Japan, US, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Norway and New Zealand (JUSSCANNZ) and Russia) and the G-77/China over developing country commitments

 The G-77/China continues to view the inadequacy of commitments in terms of the poor performance of Annex-I Parties, while developed country Parties insist that the problem is a lack of global participation, particularly by key developing countries such as China and Brazil

 Moreover, the nature of the COP-4 agenda presented a compelling opportunity for the G-77/China to maximize its leverage to secure concessions, notably within the UNFCCC- related agenda items such as technology transfer, finance and capacity building and by creating a quid pro quo between these issues and its cooperation on the work plan for the elaboration of the Kyoto Mechanisms

 The linkages between the demands by the G-77/China for financial and technical assistance, associated with a desire to remain free of any attempt by developed countries to build in conditionalities that might draw them into new commitments, led to unusually complex linkages

 Right up to the closing hours of the negotiations on Saturday morning, for example, there were long and difficult exchanges on what turned out to be a win for the G-77/China on GEF funding

 The outcome contains a number of wins for the G-77/China, such as useful gains on technology and finance issues

 The EU was conscious of the lack of attention paid to G-77/China demands in Kyoto and made serious efforts to address them in Buenos Aires

 <p>On provision of financial and technical support for the preparation of non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA inquired about the non-inclusion of an agenda item on the financial mechanism and said timing of second national communications for non-Annex I countries was subject to availability of financial resources

 The G-77/CHINA requested more information on the review process

9 (adverse effects), the Chair conveyed the decision of the SBI/SBSTA Chairs to set up a Friends of the Chair group, consisting of the Vice-Chair of SBI, Coordinator of the G-77/China, the EU, EIT and JUSCANZ, to finalize the workshop’s terms of reference on the issue

 <p> JOINT SBI/SBSTA SESSION <p>On compliance under the Protocol, the G-77/CHINA said Annex I Parties’ communications should include information on Convention implementation, particularly: policies and measures to modify longer term trends; new and additional finance; assistance to meet adaptation costs; technology transfer; and capacity building of developing countries

 <p>On AIJ under the pilot phase, the G-77/CHINA and others expressed concern at the lack of regional balance in projects

 <p>On the Protocol mechanisms, the G-77/CHINA stressed the need to, inter alia: begin with formulating principles to guide the methodological and operational process; establish a common understanding of the mechanisms; and ensure that the nature and scope of mechanisms do not perpetuate North-South inequities

 Chair Kante suggested continued discussion in a contact group and a meeting between the G-77/CHINA, the GEF and implementing agencies to exchange views on the difficulties encountered in providing financial resources for non-Annex I communications

” Some reported that the G-77/China is experiencing difficulty with the “nature and scope” of the CDM itself, including what it constitutes, whether certified emission reductions should be “tradeable” and whether a portion of project proceeds should go towards an “adaptation” fund

 Some participants suggested that with few opportunities to meet intersessionally and an unwillingness to dissolve into regional positions, the G-77/China might be unable to agree on a comprehensive position in time for serious discussion at this meeting

 Some suggested that the Secretariat could help by playing a more “facilitative role” in promoting intersessional dialogue between Parties within the G-77/China

 </p> <p>The G-77/CHINA tabled a draft decision on arrangements for COP-5

 The G-77/CHINA preferred scheduling COP-6 in October or November 2000, and objected to additional intersessional meetings of the subsidiary bodies

 The G-77/CHINA stated that it cannot support the extent of the proposed increase and noted the current trend among many Parties to support zero-growth budgets

</p> <p>On contingencies for conference services, the G-77/CHINA said the UN General Assembly should be asked to include the FCCC’s requirements in its budget

 </p> <p>On compliance under the Protocol, the G-77/CHINA said Annex I Parties’ communications should include information on Convention implementation, particularly: policies and measures to modify longer term trends; new and additional financial resources; assistance to meet adaptation costs; technology transfer; and capacity building of developing countries

 The G-77/CHINA called for a discussion on the basic principles for a compliance regime, noted a lack of submissions received from developing countries and supported the compilation of views through a questionnaire

 The G-77/CHINA indicated that it had not reached a group position on these items

 </p> <p>On Saturday, 5 June, the G-77/CHINA presented its position on compliance to the JWG

 On the nature and timing of the informal exchange, later referred to as a "workshop," the G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA and IRAN, preferred holding it after COP-5, but before the subsidiary bodies’ 12th sessions (SB-12)

 The G-77/CHINA and others expressed concern at the lack of regional balance in the distribution of pilot projects and said the AIJ project experience internationally was inadequate for a meaningful review

 The group was unable to start substantive deliberations until the second week when the G-77/CHINA circulated its position paper

</p> <p>In an initial exchange of views during the first joint Plenary session on Tuesday, 1 June, the G-77/CHINA stressed the need to, inter alia: begin with formulating principles to guide the methodological and operational process; establish a common understanding of the mechanisms; and ensure that the nature and scope of mechanisms do not perpetuate North-South inequities

</p> <p>On Tuesday, 8 June, the G-77/CHINA introduced its position papers on CDM, JI and emissions trading

 Outlining the paper on CDM, the G-77/CHINA highlighted CDM’s role in helping developing countries achieve sustainable development and developed countries comply with their QELROs

 The G-77/CHINA recommended that its paper form the basis for future negotiations

 In support, CHINA identified issues missing from the Secretariat’s synthesis report but covered in the G-77/China paper, including transparency and climate change effectiveness

 </p> <p>Regarding the contribution to sustainable development, the G-77/CHINA said the recipient country should be the sole judge of whether a project meets its sustainable development priorities

</p> <p>On sequestration, the G-77/CHINA said discussions should be avoided until the conclusion of ongoing studies by SBSTA and the IPCC

</p> <p>On technology transfer and project financing, the G-77/CHINA highlighted the dimension of additionality, a feature absent in the Chair’s draft

</p> <p>On supplementarity, the G-77/CHINA highlighted the primacy of domestic action and recommended the development of guidelines on supplementarity

 The G-77/CHINA stressed the need to address the principles and basic elements in the structure in order to guide the methodological and institutional aspects of the mechanisms’ design

 The G-77/China is entitled to argue for all the time it requires to engage effectively in the negotiations, not in the least because their futures and the future of global equity are once more intimately bound up with decision-making in the ecologically-indebted industrialized countries

 </p> <p><em>Protocol Mechanisms: </em>Controversial debates on mechanisms flared within the G-77/China

 The concepts of "unilateral CDMs," "tradeability of CERs," "emissions avoidance" and "adaptation funds" teased the G-77/China negotiators for over a week before they emerged with a document that was skillfully and carefully constructed to be open-ended on most issues

 With the benefits from the CDM flowing unevenly to different countries within the G-77/China and the lack of a significant incentive to compromise on national positions, the key issues are yet to be resolved within the G-77/China

<p>The G-77/CHINA stated that technology transfer could not take place under the market process

<p>On Saturday, 5 June, the group considered a draft decision tabled by the G-77/China on initial and subsequent non-Annex I communications

<p class="MsoNormal">On guidelines for non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA opposed changing the guidelines, as many non-Annex I countries have not finalized their first communications

<p class="MsoNormal">The G-77/CHINA called for an expert review of non-Annex I communications by non-Annex I Party experts

<p class="MsoNormal">On the timing of second national communications, the G-77/CHINA noted that there is a differentiated timetable under the FCCC for submission of national communications by Annex I and non-Annex I Parties

 The G-77/CHINA said any consideration of the LULUCF process should begin after the release of the IPCC Special Report

 Some said the failure by the G-77/China and the EU to agree on a proposed reformulation of an agenda item on the review of adequacy of commitments served as a telling reminder of the persistently contentious issues that can be expected to feature during the next two weeks

 The G-77/CHINA said it had highlighted the need for another workshop prior to COP-6

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY:</i> On the experience with AIJ, the G-77/CHINA underlined the imbalance of the geographical distribution of pilot projects and urged extension of the pilot phase

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS: </i>The Chair distributed a draft text compiling the EU and G-77/CHINA proposals on non-Annex I communications

 On the CDM, the G-77/CHINA pointed to deficiencies in the text, including the absence of a section on ï¿½nature and scopeï¿½ and the lack of a determination of what the driving force of the CDM should be

 The G-77/CHINA said technical appendices complicate the issue and stressed the need to address the technical issues

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS: </i>Participants considered a draft text compiling proposals by the EU, the G-77/CHINA and others

 The G-77/CHINA and others highlighted the need for transparency in the process and adequate developing country expert participation in the technical workshops

 In response to a query by Chair Chow, the G-77/CHINA defined a draft negotiating text as “the penultimate stage in the text that the COP will finally adopt

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS:</i> Chair El Ghaouth (Mauritania) informed delegates that a drafting group had been working on a draft text compiling proposals by the EU, the G-77/CHINA and others, and suggested that the contact group adjourn to allow the drafting group to continue its work

 The G-77/CHINA said it had prepared a draft decision covering similar aspects and including others such as guidance on the scope of the workshop on the IPCC Special Report

 Many delegations noted similarities between the two texts, and agreed to follow the sequencing of paragraphs in the G-77/CHINA proposal as a basis for discussions

 The G-77/CHINA stressed the need to address the CDM’s driving force, nature and scope

 The G-77/CHINA emphasized that CDM funding should be over and above ODA, GEF and other financial commitments

 The G-77/CHINA said funding additionality flows from the fact that the purpose of the CDM is to assist Annex I Parties in attaining their commitments <o:p> </o:p> </p> 

 The G-77/CHINA said it was clear from the agreement at COP-4 that second national communications would be funded without further guidelines

5), further informal consultations were scheduled after the G-77/CHINA said it had been unable to participate in the drafting group working on this issue due to the heavy workload at COP-5

 The G-77/CHINA said the nature and scope of emissions trading must be determined before operational details are worked out

 Some underscored the importance of this issue for COP-6 in light of the incoming G-77/China Chair

 The insistence on G-77/China involvement was linked to the level of ambition acceptable by the US and, in response, the G-77/China distanced themselves from attempts to draw developing countries into agreeing to anything that could be interpreted as new commitments

 After joint SBI/SBSTA consideration and extensive contact group debates on the flexibility mechanisms, delegates could only agree to a compilation document containing proposals from the G-77/China, the EU and the US on the issues for discussion and framework for implementation

2(a) and (b) (policies and measures by Annex I Parties), following objections to the title by the G-77/CHINA, who preferred to substitute it with the “review of adequacy of implementation of FCCC Articles 4

 The COP adopted the agenda including item 5 as it stood, and recorded the amendment proposed by the G-77/CHINA in a footnote

 The contact group considered the Co-Chairs’ proposal for a draft decision on capacity building that was based on a G-77/China proposal and incorporated submissions from the EU and other Annex I Parties

<p class="MsoNormal">Many delegates welcomed the G-77/CHINA proposal for a draft decision on capacity building (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/MISC

 The G-77/China draft decision called on the COP to, inter alia: conduct capacity building activities in and for developing countries; provide the necessary financial and technical support to strengthen national focal points; promote climate-related research and studies; and promote capacity building of national institutions and expertise

<p class="MsoNormal">In discussing the G-77/China proposal, delegates highlighted, inter alia: the inclusion of EITs in capacity-building activities (EU, KAZAKHSTAN); that capacity building be “for,” “by” and “in” developing countries (the PHILIPPINES); the need for a coordinated response among existing efforts in capacity building (CANADA); the lack of utility in holding short workshops, as developing countries need continuous ones (CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC); and the identification of non-Annex I Parties’ needs by analyzing their national communications (EU)

 Delegates considered draft decisions submitted by the Chair, the EU and the G-77/China

<p class="MsoNormal">In the joint SBI/SBSTA session on Tuesday, 26 October, the G-77/CHINA underlined the imbalance of the geographical distribution of pilot projects and urged extension of the pilot phase

<p class="MsoNormal">CHINA noted the meaningful participation of the G-77/CHINA in the negotiation process

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>AIJ Under the Pilot Phase:</i> This issue, the only one which required a final resolution at COP-5, exposed the fissures developing within the G-77/China on issues related to the mechanisms and conflicting perceptions regarding possible gains to be realized

 This balance also illustrates the tensions and volatility of the G-77/China vis à vis its engagement with the process

 An example was the Saudi Arabian delegation’s use of its position as G-77/China coordinator on the bunker fuel issue to pursue its own interests as an oil producing country at the expense of the wider group

 Within the G-77/China, however, many Parties are challenging the Saudis’ attempts to usurp some of the Group’s negotiating positions for its own ends

 In response, the G-77/China distanced itself from attempts to draw developing countries into agreeing to new commitments

 The G-77/CHINA expressed concern that the "sink" in Annex I countries would create an entitlement to emit, and called for appropriate carbon accounting approaches

 Others also noted that divisions within the G-77/China on adverse effects were becoming more apparent by the day

 The G-77/CHINA favored simpler text referring to "compliance with the Kyoto Protocol

 The G-77/CHINA proposed adding, <i>inter alia</i>: the need for training in specialized fields; establishment of regional centers to facilitate a rapid response to natural disasters; and improved monitoring and forecasting of disease vectors

<p>The G-77/CHINA proposed additional amendments to the Chair’s text that stress the need for: capacity building to contribute to sustainable development; partnership with, and assistance from, developed countries; and proper guidance from intergovernmental organizations, such as the GEF, UNDP, and World Bank, to ensure that access to resources is transparent, with clear and less cumbersome procedures

<p>On the Draft Conclusions on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry, SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by a number of Parties, including TUVALU speaking for the G-77/CHINA, proposed deleting text on convening an intersessional consultation on LULUCF after SBSTA-13

 Noting the lack of time, the G-77/China objected to consideration of elements of a draft decision

 Switzerland, opposed by the G-77/China, proposed that a contact group be established using the Chair’s consolidated text as a basis for discussion

 The G-77/China presented alternative text on the terms of reference

 The EU, Poland, Switzerland and the G-77/China urged that the terms of reference be considered at SBSTA-13, while Australia, Canada, Japan and the US proposed consideration after COP-6

 The text proposed by the EU and G-77/China on terms of reference for a workshop on P&amp;Ms was not adopted

 Venezuela, on behalf of the G-77/China, expressed disappointment at the lack of substantive progress regarding preparations for a workshop

 Brazil, on behalf of the G-77/China, emphasized that work on LULUCF should be guided by the ultimate objective of the FCCC and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities

 On additional intersessional work, the G-77/China highlighted the need for non-Annex I capacity building on LULUCF, and called for regional workshops

 The G-77/China undertook to provide SBSTA with consolidated text on this issue on 14 June

 Saudi Arabia and the G-77/China highlighted the fact that FCCC Articles 4

 The G-77/China reiterated their preference for two draft decisions, with the EU, Australia, Japan, the US and Switzerland expressing preference for a single decision

 The G-77/China supported the development of text for discussion at the informal meetings prior to SB-13 and noted that, under BAPA, COP-6 needs to develop initial actions rather than simply a process

 The G-77/China said binding consequences would only apply to Annex I Parties

<p>On the Functions of the compliance body, the G-77/China, with Saudi Arabia and Samoa, opposed a screening function

 On Participation of Parties, the G-77/China said the Party concerned could comment on any information used by the compliance body as a basis for its deliberation

 The G-77/China proposed additional amendments that stressed the need for: capacity building to contribute to sustainable development; partnership with, and assistance from developed countries; and proper guidance from intergovernmental organizations, such as the GEF, UNDP, and the World Bank, to ensure that access to resources is transparent with clear and less cumbersome procedures

<p>The G-77/China expressed satisfaction at the positive contribution of SB-12 and the preceding informal meetings in moving toward achieving the goals set out under the BAPA

 In achieving agreement on text that will form the basis of negotiations at SB-13, the contact group Co-Chairs charted a difficult line between the positions taken by the G-77/China, the EU and the Umbrella Group, an informal alliance of like-minded developed countries, including Australia, Canada, Japan and the US

<p>The G-77/China demonstrated proactive participation

 Doubts that had been expressed earlier over Nigeria’s chairmanship of the G-77/ China, given its membership in OPEC, fell away as the group’s issue coordinators appeared to have sufficient flexibility to develop and represent the broader G-77/China perspectives, such as in LULUCF

 NIGERIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, conveyed the Group’s condolences

 SAUDI ARABIA, speaking for the G-77/CHINA, said the paragraphs were applicable to all elements of reporting and should be retained

 The strong position taken by the G-77/China over logistical considerations that might impact developing country participation caused some to question how much will be achieved prior to COP-6

<p>In the ensuing discussion, the G-77/CHINA questioned the value of the CDI as a separate initiative, noting that much of what had been raised through this process had been previously elaborated in COP decisions

<p>The G-77/CHINA requested the GEF to present a full report on the CDI at COP-6, and asked if it was funded from the budget allocated for climate change activities

 The G-77/CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, and a number of other developing countries repeated their proposal for two separate draft decisions, one on FCCC Article 4

<p>On the preliminary examination of questions, the G-77/CHINA said the functions it envisaged at this stage were to ensure that the question is supported by sufficient information and is not <i>de minimis</i>, and to direct the case to a particular branch

 The G-77/China inquired what the basis for such a review would be and if this would constitute an additional reporting requirement

<p>On demonstration projects, the G-77/CHINA said these were not critical in identifying needs and stressed that sufficient information had already been submitted

<p>The G-77/CHINA underscored Parties’ obligation to submit information on how they are implementing their commitments

 With the G-77/CHINA, she noted with concern that GEF is allocating funds to technology needs assessments instead of national communications

 The G-77/CHINA bracketed most of the text, citing insufficient time to consider it

<p>On supplementarity, the EU, G-77/CHINA and HUNGARY emphasized domestic action as the primary means to fulfill commitments

 The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the US, NEW ZEALAND and AUSTRALIA, suggested differentiating between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties

 Some suggest that this reflects the predictable divergence of interests and priorities among sub-groups within the G-77/China, readily apparent during the informals

<p>NIGERIA, speaking for the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern that developed countries were not engaging in meaningful FCCC implementation

<p>The G-77/CHINA called for the will to implement "long overdue" actions on FCCC Article 4

<p>On the Executive Board (EB), NORWAY, CANADA, JAPAN and the US, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, highlighted a role for the EB in determining new baseline and monitoring methodologies

 The G-77/CHINA expressed concern that the EB has been gaining at the cost of the COP/MOP

<p>On Purposes, the G-77/CHINA proposed specifying that the text shall serve as a framework for implementation of FCCC Article 4

 AUSTRALIA and the US, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA and SAMOA, said the information to be compiled by the Secretariat should be based exclusively on information supplied in the national communications

 The G-77/CHINA, supported by several members of its group, said it was premature to decide on one option since the mode of adoption depends on the content of the procedures and mechanisms

 On the consequences of the facilitative branch, the G-77/CHINA rejected an EU proposal that does not differentiate between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties

 The G-77/CHINA favored a narrow scope such as issues of due process and Article 3

<p align="justify"><font size="3">The G-77/CHINA highlighted the importance to the Group of Article 4

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Reviewing the state of negotiations entering the final week, a number of developing country delegates expressed frustration at what they believe are attempts to block progress on priority issues for the G-77/China ï¿½ such as funding, capacity building and technology transfer

 President Pronkï¿½s proposal to consider outstanding issues by dividing ministers into three negotiating groups has generated concern within the G-77/China

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Emphasizing its commitment to make COP-6 a genuine success, the G-77/CHINA expressed its concerns on funding, capacity building, technology transfer, UNFCCC Article 4

 He then listed the G-77/China coordinators for each of the outstanding issues

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Another relevant point of discussion has been the the sequence in which ministers should take up the "crunch issues," with the G-77/China pushing to prioritize financial commitments and other key issues for developing countries

 The G-77/CHINA argued that the host developing country should be the sole judge in deciding on the project

 The G-77/China said it was not able to participate in the discussion, noting the absence of its issue coordinators and the need for sufficient time to consider the whole issue in context

<p align="justify"><font size="3">On the implementation of enabling environments, the G-77/China said developing countries’ actions depend on implementation of Annex I commitments

 Discussion on the proposed adaptation fund and the fund supporting specific concerns of LDCs was referred to a financial issues group proposed by President Pronk, despite the reservations expressed by the G-77/China, who held that the financial issues relating to the decision(s) under Article 4

 They also discussed the use of criteria and quantitative parameters to assess the effectiveness of P&amp;Ms and the call by the G-77/China and Saudi Arabia for an assessment of the actions of Annex I Parties in striving to implement P&amp;Ms in such a way as to minimize adverse effects

 The EU and G-77/China underscored that future work on P&amp;Ms should contribute to an assessment of demonstrable progress of Annex I Parties in achieving their Protocol commitments

 Canada, with the support of Japan, Australia and the US, and opposed by the G-77/China and the EU, proposed replacing the existing decision and its associated initiatives with alternative text stating that consideration of demonstrable progress cannot take place until the SBSTA has considered the issue pursuant to the guidelines that may be elaborated under Article 7, given that Articles 2 and 3

 However, to imagine that agreement on these issues alone would have saved the talks in the last hour is to make the arrogant – and mistaken – assumption that this would have proved acceptable to the G-77/China

 Although these proposals could be viewed as being a positive step, the texts still link funding under the UNFCCC to actions under the Protocol, an issue on which the G-77/China strongly objects

<p align="justify"><font size="3">IRAN, for the G-77/CHINA, supported completion of work forwarded from COP-6 Part II, adding that this is not the right forum to raise the question of new or additional commitments by developing countries

 SAUDI ARABIA and the G-77/CHINA stressed the inclusion of developing country scientists, and literature in languages other than English

<p align="justify"><font size="3">The G-77/CHINA then introduced a proposal on the composition of ERTs and the selection of Lead Reviewers, based on a formula considering both UN regional representation, and Annex I and non-Annex I membership

 Although the deal was accepted by most regional groups, including the G-77/China and the EU, the Umbrella Group (a loose alliance of Annex I Parties that includes Canada, Australia, Japan, the Russian Federation, and New Zealand) did not join the consensus, with key issues of dispute including eligibility requirements and bankability under the mechanisms

 Uganda, for the LDCs, supported adopting the improved guidelines at COP-10, while the G-77/China preferred COP-9

 Regarding dates for workshops, and the review of the terms of reference for the CGE, the G-77/China proposed two workshops be held in 2002, and that the terms of reference be reviewed at COP-8, to which delegates agreed

 Iran, for the G-77/China, stated that neither COP-7 nor the WSSD was the appropriate forum for raising the issue of new commitments for developing countries

 The G-77/China said the agreement marked the "end of a long journey" toward achieving ratification of the Protocol, and said there had been many sacrifices made to gain agreement, particularly on the part of developing countries

 But it was apparent that in making this deal, the EU and the G-77/China had been compelled to concede to many of the demands of key Umbrella Group countries

 At one point, the G-77/China responded to a Japanese request with a deeply felt "you must be joking!" But they were not, and their stubbornness paid off, as evidenced in particular by their success in securing an expedited procedure for the reinstatement of mechanisms’ eligibility

 Although the deal struck on the compliance text provides all Parties with cause for satisfaction, it is the EU and the G-77/China that gained the most, with almost all of their demands adopted

<p align="justify"><font size="3">Other positive and innovative developments include: the consideration of gender balance in future bodies established under the UNFCCC; integration of Principles on LULUCF in the Article 7 guidelines; and the establishment of the new "removal unit" (RMU) on the basis of a G-77/China proposal

 Although the deal was accepted by most regional groups, including the G-77/China and the EU, the Umbrella Group (a loose alliance of Annex I Parties that includes Canada, Australia, Japan, the Russian Federation, and New Zealand) did not join the consensus, with key areas of dispute including eligibility requirements and bankability under the mechanisms

 VENEZUELA, for the G-77/CHINA, said that the recent focus on the Protocol has meant that some UNFCCC issues have been neglected, particularly those relevant to developing countries

 CANADA said the provisional agenda correctly referred to a proposal and, supported by several Annex I Parties and UZBEKISTAN, but opposed by SAUDI ARABIA and the G-77/CHINA, stressed retaining the issue as worded in the provisional agenda

 KENYA, for the G-77/CHINA, said the geographic distribution of projects should be improved, particularly for Africa

 The G-77/CHINA noted that some aspects are missing, and stressed the LULUCF guiding Principles, particularly one on non-permanence

 TUVALU, supported by the G-77/CHINA and opposed by NEW ZEALAND and CANADA, proposed including development of modalities for the application of the Principles

 Under the section on input, the G-77/CHINA proposed that an options paper be compiled on modalities for crediting LULUCF units under the CDM

 BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, said it was waiting for outcomes from the group on LULUCF under the CDM

<p align="justify">The G-77/CHINA suggested compiling an options paper on modalities for accounting, reporting and review aspects, while the EU, CANADA and JAPAN preferred integrating these issues into the other options papers

 VENEZUELA, for the G-77/CHINA, said little time remained for this discussion and preferred the Chair’s suggestion

 The G-77/CHINA maintained that the draft conclusions failed to reflect the wider implementation of activities

<p align="justify">At the conclusion of the meeting, the G-77/CHINA proposed an additional paragraph outlining principles for addressing P&amp;Ms

 Co-Chair Giroux highlighted existing text that he believed addressed this issue, and suggested placing the proposal in brackets pending further internal G-77/CHINA consultations

 The G-77/CHINA suggested adding a new paragraph stating that SBSTA agrees to further elaborate the pending parts of the guidelines following the result of the process of developing definitions and modalities for including LULUCF under the CDM

 Venezuela, on behalf of the G-77/China, said that the recent focus on the Protocol has meant some UNFCCC issues have been neglected, particularly those relevant to developing countries

<p align="justify">On a proposal by Canada on cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy, the G-77/China said the item was incorrectly worded on the provisional agenda, and that it should refer to the report of the workshop on this issue, not to a proposal

 Kenya, on behalf of the G-77/China, said the geographic distribution of projects should be improved, particularly for Africa

 Brazil, speaking for the G-77/China, stressed that the draft TOR and work agenda from the workshop served as a basis for negotiation only, and China called for further exchange of views

 The G-77/China stressed the relevance of the LULUCF guiding Principles, particularly on non-permanence

 Participants debated how to consider accounting, reporting and review aspects when developing definitions and modalities for including LULUCF under the CDM, as proposed by the G-77/China

<p align="justify">The G-77/China suggested compiling a paper on different options for addressing modalities for accounting, reporting and review aspects, while the EU, Canada and Japan preferred integrating these issues into the other options papers

 He informed the SBSTA that agreement had been reached, with the exception of a G-77/China proposal to amend three references in the text to relate specifically to "Annex I" Parties

1(b) (cooperation on P&amp;Ms), and Saudi Arabia, on behalf of the G-77/China, highlighted the need to minimize the impact of Annex I Parties’ P&amp;Ms on developing countries

 Venezuela, on behalf of the G-77/China, said examination of the term "developing countries" was not necessary

 Pakistan, on behalf of the G-77/China, expressed the Group’s continued commitment to the WSSD and noted concerns that Parties were failing to fulfill their Rio commitments

 Divergence within the G-77/China was also apparent on this issue, with many smaller countries, such as some AOSIS members, also more eager to deal with long-term commitments

 Although the deal was accepted by most regional groups, including the G-77/China and the EU, the Umbrella Group (a loose alliance of Annex I Parties that includes Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the Russian Federation) did not join the consensus

 INDIA, for the G-77/CHINA, preferred using the Chair’s text

<p align="justify">On non-Annex I commitments, the G-77/CHINA opposed any text that would infer new commitments

<p align="justify">On decision text adopting the improved guidelines, the EU, supported by the US and opposed by the G-77/CHINA, asked for text noting the need for review of the guidelines

 JAPAN, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, preferred stating language that the guidelines "shall be used" instead of "should be used" to ensure the comparability of national communications

<p align="justify">On non-Annex I commitments, the G-77/China opposed any text that would infer new commitments

<p align="justify">The G-77/China, with the US and China, expressed its full support for the Delhi Declaration

<p align="justify">The initial draft of the Delhi Declaration stressed adaptation and did not contain a single reference to the Kyoto Protocol, pleasing the OPEC member States chairing the G-77/China

 The US reportedly supported the G-77/China position, and in the final plenary, was the only Annex I country to state its complete satisfaction with the Declaration, which does not call for any follow-up action whatsoever, let alone the initiation of a dialogue

 The G-77/China refused to negotiate after a time, citing a lack of progress in negotiations on Protocol Article 2

<p align="justify">The issue of the adverse effects of policies and measures on developing countries, meanwhile, was used by the G-77/China at COP-8 to ensure delegates focused on the question of adaptation in developing countries, rather than mitigation

 The G-77/China cast mitigation exclusively in terms of the implementation of existing commitments, repeatedly noting in discussions on P&amp;Ms that Annex I Parties’ emissions continue to increase, and that their policies and measures are not designed to minimize adverse effects

 The argument made by most Annex I Parties and some developing countries particularly threatened by climate change, that adaptation will ultimately be useless unless climate change is allayed by global mitigation efforts, did not seem to have any impact on the leaders of G-77/China

 Other more sympathetic observers believed the US objected to stem discussion on adverse effects, which the G-77/China had linked to the Canadian proposal during discussions on the SB-16 agenda

 The G-77/CHINA, with SAUDI ARABIA, BURKINA FASO, and the EU, called for increased funding for the participation of delegates from developing countries

 The G-77/CHINA underscored the importance of maintaining the UNFCCC and Protocol as separate and distinct bodies, both legally and procedurally

<p align="justify">The G-77/CHINA preferred addressing mitigation and adaptation separately

<p align="justify">AUSTRALIA, CANADA, the EU, JAPAN and NEW ZEALAND, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, stressed the importance of considering cross-cutting elements and the integration of adaptation and mitigation

<p align="justify">There were divergent views over whether to delete reference to "progress made," with the G-77/CHINA preferring language indicating that little or no progress has been made in implementing decision 5/CP

 The G-77/CHINA said the process of submissions could delay the organization of the workshop, noting that decision 5/CP

 Some noted that one countryï¿½s interventions in the P&amp;Ms contact group appeared to express "more than a liberal interpretation" of the G-77/China mandate

 Notwithstanding the divergence of views within the G-77/China, several Parties to the Protocol have concerns about exchanging information on ways to minimize the adverse effects of response measures

 CANADA, with the EU, NORWAY and JAPAN, and opposed by the G-77/CHINA, proposed that the SCCF support adaptation and mitigation activities

 ARGENTINA, supported by the G-77/CHINA and others, said that adaptation projects are of global benefit and should be given the highest priority under the SCCF

<p align="justify">The G-77/CHINA proposed a new paragraph requesting the Secretariat to compile a synthesis report on information regarding the specific needs and concerns of developing countries arising from the adverse effects of climate change and response measures, and the support required to address these

 The G-77/CHINA said that this was an unrelated proposal that did not constitute alternative text

 The G-77/CHINA maintained its support for text on actions relating to the workshop’s results that could be recommended by the SBI and SBSTA

 The G-77/CHINA proposed text on the outcomes of the workshops on insurance and risk assessment and on related actions, which the EU and US opposed, stating that the reports were not available for consideration at SBI-18

 The G-77/CHINA preferred to state in the conclusions that there was no agreement, or transmit the bracketed text to SBI-19

<p align="justify">At the SBSTA Plenary on Wednesday, 4 June, the G-77/China, said the TAR’s conclusions should be used cautiously

 Switzerland said that the TAR should be routinely considered in all agenda items and, opposed by the G-77/China, suggested that future annotated agendas should reference the TAR

 China, supported by the EU and G-77/China, suggested focusing on the scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of adaptation and mitigation

 The G-77/China and the US opposed establishing a process for considering the TAR in COP and SB agenda items

 The G-77/China, the Russian Federation and the US objected to text requesting the Secretariat to develop a draft work programme on the TAR

 The G-77/China preferred addressing mitigation and adaptation separately, and opposed considering integrated approaches to adaptation and mitigation

 Canada, the EU, Japan and Switzerland, opposed by the G-77/China, preferred to consider adaptation and mitigation under one agenda item

 The G-77/China suggested these issues be addressed in the body of the text, instead of the annex

 The EU, G-77/China and Switzerland emphasized the need to design guidelines according to specific country needs

 The G-77/China addressed the need to define non-permanence and consider uncertainty, while others noted the importance of developing modalities for small-scale CDM projects

 The G-77/China opposed additional workshops, regardless of their TOR, citing budgetary constraints and the need for "a total discussion" on the implementation of decision 13/ CP

 The G-77/China said the text should refer only to Annex I Parties and should not directly or indirectly encourage non-Annex I Parties to share information

 The G-77/China, opposed by Australia, the EU, Japan, and the US, requested that text referring to information sharing at side events be deleted

 Saudi Arabia, on behalf of the G-77/China, objected to text referring to information exchange among "all Parties," and to text "inviting Annex I Parties and other interested Parties" to share information during informal round-tables

 Following a short break for consultations, the G-77/China was unable to agree on a united position on the text

 The EU and Japan, opposed by the G-77/China, reiterated their request to delete the sentence calling for information exchange on ways to minimize the adverse effects of response measures

 Canada, with the EU and G-77/China, said governments must respond to the observation needs of the UNFCCC

<p align="justify">At the SBSTA Plenary on Friday, 6 June, the G-77/China requested, <i>inter alia</i>, that this issue be a regular agenda item, and that SBSTA consider a draft decision on initial actions

 On Friday, 13 June, Chair Thorgeirsson noted that a submission on this issue had been received from the G-77/China (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/MISC

 Switzerland, supported by the G-77/China, proposed the inclusion of non-Annex I national communications on the agenda

 The US, supported by Canada and Australia, and opposed by the G-77/China, proposed that this item address the submission of second and subsequent national communications

 Chair Stoycheva agreed to suspend the adoption of the agenda to allow the G-77/China to consider the US proposal

 The G-77/China and AOSIS expressed concern that emissions could continue to rise despite mitigation measures, and urged Annex I Parties to implement more rigorous policies and measures

<p align="justify">In the opening SBI Plenary on Thursday, 4 June, AOSIS and the G-77/China emphasized the need for the SCCF to support adaptation activities, and with the EU and Ghana, underscored the importance of providing finance to countries that are not eligible for support under existing UNFCCC funds

 On the SCCF's guiding principles, the G-77/China said that the Fund should be complementary to the GEF climate focal areas, the Least Developed Country (LDC) Fund, and bilateral and multilateral funding, and maximize adaptation funding opportunities for non-Annex I Parties not eligible for support from the LDC Fund

<p align="justify">On the review process, the G-77/China stressed that it should contain an analysis of current project and programme implementation in response to decision 2/CP

 The G-77/China preferred focusing on the period after COP-7, while Canada and others noted that capacity building was a long-term process

 The G-77/China opposed this, stating that the progress to date was insufficient, and called for concrete actions to follow up on the recommendations of the recent risk assessment and insurance workshops

 Since the G-77/China had not consulted on the proposed draft conclusions, the meeting was adjourned

<p align="justify">On Monday, 9 June, the G-77/China and EU presented their proposals for draft conclusions

<p align="justify">They also discussed how to elaborate on the TOR for the workshop on economic diversification, with the G-77/China opposing a process of submissions, noting that this could delay the workshop

 The Secretariat revised the Co-Chairs’ proposal integrating the G-77/China and EU suggestions to reflect amendments made during the discussion

 During this meeting, the G-77/China proposed a new paragraph requesting the Secretariat to compile a synthesis report on information regarding the specific needs and concerns of developing countries arising from the adverse effects of climate change and response measures, and the support required to address these

 The G-77/China said that this was an unrelated proposal that did not constitute alternative text

 The G-77/China maintained its support for text on actions relating to the workshop’s results that could be recommended by the SBI and SBSTA

 The G-77/China proposed text on the outcomes of the workshops on insurance and risk assessment and on related actions, which the EU and US opposed, citing the unavailability of the written reports for consideration at SBI-18

 The G-77/China preferred to state in the conclusions that there was no agreement, or to transmit the bracketed text to SBI-19

 The G-77/China, with Saudi Arabia, Burkina Faso, and the EU, called for increased funding for the participation of delegates from developing countries

 The G-77/China, Argentina, and Brazil noted that the new UN General Assembly scale of assessments should not be applied automatically

 Some observers noted that OPEC’s arguments in this regard served other members of the G-77/China that are equally concerned about any emphasis on the need for mitigation in developing countries

 Saudi Arabia, speaking for the G-77/China, argued that text should not directly or indirectly encourage non-Annex I Parties to share information

 However, at least one member of the G-77/China said that it did not share Saudi Arabia’s perspective

<p align="justify">Ultimately, negotiations broke down when Saudi Arabia, again on behalf of the G-77/China, refused the EU and Japan’s demand that a sentence explicitly requiring information exchange on ways to minimize the adverse effects of response measures be deleted

<p align="justify">On the sub-item dealing with the consideration of the fifth compilation and synthesis of initial national communications, the G-77/CHINA, opposed by the US, objected to a document tabled by the Secretariat on steps taken by non-Annex I Parties to reduce emissions

 The G-77/CHINA, and others, proposed that the agenda sub-item not be restricted to decision 5/CP

<p align="justify">On factoring out, BRAZIL, for the G-77/China, supported by the EU, said this reflected principles agreed in the Marrakesh Accords and needs to be addressed before the second commitment period

 The G-77/CHINA highlighted the need for equitable geographic distribution of designated operational entities (DOE) and financial and technical assistance to promote the emergence of such entities in developing countries

 NIGERIA, for the G-77/China, said the decision could not be used as the basis of negotiation, emphasizing that it did not contain suffi­cient guidance on operational procedures, including a review process, and that it lacked reference to the additionality of the funds

 He requested the Co-Chairs to prepare a new draft decision and adjourn the meeting to allow the G-77/China time to consult internally

 Following a break for informal consul­tations by the G-77/China, the Co-Chairs adjourned the meeting

 Noting the need to further discuss the themes and issues to be considered by SBSTA under the two new agenda items, the G-77/CHINA objected to forwarding the draft decision to the COP

 CANADA, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, said discussions on information, methods and tools for socioeconomic scenario-building should be included, while NEW ZEALAND suggested that the issue should be discussed with ï¿½projectionsï¿½ matters

 Opposed by the EU, the G-77/CHINA suggested removing reference to Article 4

<p align="justify">Parties deliberated whether the preparation of national communications has provided a "valuable opportunity" for capacity building, with the G-77/CHINA urging deletion of this reference

 Opposed by the G-77/CHINA, JAPAN preferred removing reference to "further" financial and technical support for enhancing national capacities

 The EU, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, suggested that workshops could address all thematic areas in a combined approach, rather than addressing one theme only

 The G-77/CHINA and EU objected, noting the importance of capacity-building experts agreeing on the text first

<p align="justify">On Monday, the G-77/CHINA suggested deleting text on recognizing that the submission of national communications would ensure that the COP has sufficient information to assess the UNFCCC’s implementation in a timely manner

 The G-77/CHINA objected, and said the Group would consult on this matter internally

 The G-77/CHINA proposed referring to the IPCC statement to SBSTA when taking note of the IPCC report on factoring out

 Opposing this proposal, the G-77/CHINA suggested referring to text in a draft COP/MOP decision contained in decision 11/CP

 MOROCCO, for the G-77/CHINA, said adaptation and mitigation measures will be unsuccessful if developed countries ignore the concerns and situation of vulnerable States

 The G-77/CHINA called for effective support for technology transfer in non-Annex I Parties and research to encourage local-level capacity building

 Opposing the G-77/China, several Parties emphasized the need to begin work on the new agenda items

 The G-77/China, New Zealand and Thailand stressed the need to determine the workshop’s scope

 The G-77/China, Saudi Arabia and Oman objected to drafting a COP decision, while the EU, Norway, New Zealand, the Russian Federation and Canada expressed support for it

<p align="justify">The G-77/China and the EU highlighted the importance of factoring out, saying it reflected principles agreed in the Marrakesh Accords, and therefore needed to be addressed before the second commitment period

 Stressing the importance of sustained funding for regional action plans, the G-77/China suggested that guidance on this issue should be given to the GEF

 Referring to SBSTA-17 conclusions containing a provision on this matter, Co-Chair Barrell asked the G-77/China whether a new provision on this was necessary

 The G-77/China said they would consult internally

<p align="justify">On the sub-item dealing with the consideration of the fifth compilation and synthesis of initial national communications, the G-77/China, opposed by the US, objected to a document tabled by the Secretariat on steps taken by non-Annex I Parties to reduce emissions

 The G-77/China noted that the preparation of national communications is a continuous process, but that the frequency of submissions is a "non-issue

<p align="justify">In the contact group on Monday, 8 December, the G-77/China suggested deleting text recognizing that the submission of national communications would ensure that the COP has sufficient information to assess the UNFCCC’s implementation in a timely manner

 The G-77/China suggested text stating that frequency of submissions of national communications shall be dependent on the availability of funding

 The US, opposed by the G-77/China, recommended text requiring non-Annex I Parties to submit national inventories every two years

 The G-77/China underscored the importance of addressing sources of finance and mechanisms for dispersal

 Nigeria, for the G-77/China, said the draft decision could not be used as the basis of negotiation, emphasizing that it did not contain sufficient guidance on operational procedures

 The G-77/China said that the SCCF should be financed from new and additional funds, and that the funding level of the SCCF should match that of the GEF’s climate change focal area

 The G-77/China, opposed by the EU and Norway, stressed the need for text supporting predictable and adequate funding levels

 The G-77/China expressed concerns that the draft decision had not incorporated elements regarding the predictability and the new and additional nature of the funding, and had excluded references to technology transfer as it relates to adaptation

 Opposing a proposal by the EU to include references to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the G-77/China insisted that such references should only be addressed in the preambular text

 The G-77/China proposed alternative text regarding the prioritization of, and funding for, economic diversification activities

 The G-77/China, Argentina, China, and Saudi Arabia expressed concern over lack of progress on this issue and suggested that developed countries were failing to meet their COP-7 obligations

<p align="justify">In closing, the G-77/China said the achievements made at COP-9 provided hope for the future

<p align="justify">On the other hand, some observers commented with surprise on the G-77/China’s prohibitive stance to advancing substantive consideration of the IPCC TAR, as this not only limits work on mitigation, but also on adaptation, a major concern to a large, although not necessarily very powerful, faction of the G-77/China group

<p align="justify" class="Body"> <font face="Verdana" size="2">The G-77/CHINA called on SBSTA to identify financial resources to address the needs identified in the Technology Needs Assessments
