 <p> Algeria, on behalf of the G-77, urged parties to the Convention not to go beyond the original mandate

 China said that it did not approve of any attempt to make developing countries accept concrete restrictive targets through amending the Convention or negotiating new protocols

 India said there is still a lack of clarity on several concepts in the Convention, including full incremental costs, joint implementation and transfer of technology

 While India recognized the need to address reduction of greenhouse gases beyond the year 2000, he did not believe that this is the time to strengthen commitments, since INC negotiations on a new protocol could distract from establishing a fundamental basis to implement the existing Convention

<p> Algeria, on behalf of the G-77, urged parties to the Convention not to go beyond the original mandate

 Poland said the Secretariat"s recommended schedule of national communications " every two years " is too expensive for Parties and would not produce new information

 Japan said the due date for the second national communications should be delayed, but he supported annual emissions inventory updates

 <p> Russia said the synthesis report did not yet present a clear picture of emissions trends

 Switzerland said naming specific Parties would be acceptable in the synthesis report

 Norway said the synthesis report clearly indicates that further action is needed to meet Convention objectives, and supported naming Parties in the synthesis report, the Secretariat"s recommendation on periodicity, and improved guidelines and evaluation of policy measures

 <p> Hungary recommended averaging several years" emissions rather than using one year for an inventory baseline

 Mauritius said the Secretariat should consider non-Annex 1 Parties' communications in reviewing guidelines

 Canada said Parties need to resolve deviations from the guidelines, requested flexibility on the exact date for submissions and supported annual inventories by Annex 1 Parties

 China said the 15 submissions fail to meet the Convention"s requirements because many lack documentation and evaluations of policies, and do not describe financial contributions to developing countries

 France, on behalf of the EU, said that the synthesis report should be more flexible in naming Parties, periodicity could await subsidiary bodies" advice, and annual inventories should be extended to all GHGs

 Argentina supported naming Parties and the Secretariat"s proposed timetable

 The Philippines, on behalf of the G-77 and China, said they are more concerned with full implementation of the Convention than with reviewing the adequacy of commitments

 The Philippines said that the G-77 had not readressed its INC-10 position on this issue and she could not speak on their behalf

 <p> Sub-paragraph 1(a)(vii): France suggested that this sub-paragraph, on mobilization of funds, be deleted because the sub-paragraph requires the funding mechanism to ensure predictability of resources, and shifts the commitment to ensure funds onto the operating entity

 Japan also had difficulty accepting this sub-paragraph

 However, Egypt, India and the Philippines voiced strong objections

 China reminded delegates that this sub-paragraph added no new requirements and took two days of negotiation during INC-10

 The US, supported by Japan, Australia and Canada, introduced draft language for a decision on Joint Implementation (JI) and an appendix on criteria

 France, on behalf of the EU, and supported by Australia, said that Annex I Parties should not use JI to meet their present commitments

 <p> China said JI means implementation of national policies between Annex I Parties and, thus, applies only to developed country Parties

 <p> Australia supported a phased approach beginning with pilot phase that has projects with readily identified reduction targets but allocates no credits

 Supporting China"s positions on voluntary participation and against shifting of commitments, Australia stressed the need to keep the institutional arrangements as simple as possible

 Canada said JI is a cost-effective opportunity for collaboration on projects that will lead to reductions that would not otherwise occur, helping other environmental concerns in the host country and providing access to technology

 <p> Saudi Arabia, supported by Kuwait, Iran and Nigeria, said that the pilot phase of JI should be limited to Annex I Parties and the experience gained from the pilot phase could be used for the next phase

 Chile supported JI as a multilateral system with a monitoring mechanism and accepted the idea of a pilot phase with a certain percentage of credits for developed and developing countries

 The Philippines noted that the G-77 and China have not yet come up with a definite decision on this matter or on the assessment of funding needs

 Colombia said that the COP should begin to work on the MOU before the Secretariat of the Convention begins its talks with the GEF

<p> Peru asked about the specific composition of the consultative mechanism and the criteria for its creation

 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Sudan called for its retention

 France (on behalf of the EU), Fiji, Australia, Kenya, Benin and the UK understood the concerns, however, worried about setting a precedent

 <p> For paragraph 4, on meetings of subsidiary bodies, the EU and Argentina commented that convening the meetings in conjunction with the sessions of the COP would not allow the Secretariat time to disseminate the results

 The Russian Federation and Japan have not completed their analyses of the proposals

 Zimbabwe is flexible

 Nigeria said that economics and co-location are logical considerations, but hoped that this would not prevent developing countries from hosting other UN secretariats

 China responded that the G-77 and China would revise the guidelines, that transparency was a relative term in light of some Annex 1 communications, and that simplified guidelines would cost less to apply than scholastic, bombastic and complicated forms from the existing guidelines

 France, on behalf of the EU, said "simplified" leaves a broad scope for interpretation, and suggested that developing countries could use IPCC default guidelines

 The Chair asked if China would accept adding "defaults," but China reiterated that the IPCC guidelines are too cumbersome

 China said the amendment sounded like bombs to developing countries

 France said the language could be amended to refer to previous decisions of the INC on guidelines, inventories and national communications

 China accepted "taking account the decisions of the INC" and the paragraph was adopted

 China said that under the Convention both the SBSTA and SBI are parallel organizations and suggested that SBSTA provide advice to the COP and not the SBI

 <p> The Philippines suggested combining the second and third bullets of Appendix 1 to read, "On behalf of the Conference of Parties request climate change related scientific research from competent international bodies, including <i>inter alia</i>, IPCC; compile and synthesize scientific and technical information on the global situation in climate change

" The Philippines said implications were covered by references to assessments elsewhere in the draft

 Uruguay objected since the amendment questioned the role of the IPCC by giving other organizations comparable status

 Uruguay said the proposal emphasized the scientific nature of the IPCC, but that the authority of subsidiary bodies over the IPCC needed to be clear

 The Netherlands said the IPCC should remain independent and not receive instructions from the COP

 China said the Convention"s existence changes the IPCC, and the IPCC has to respond to requests from the Secretariat

 The Philippines and China noted that developing countries would need funding to attend

 The Philippines expressed resentment that he had not been allowed to finish

 The Philippines said that the two paragraphs should be discussed

 <p> After a recess, the Philippines apologized and read the two paragraphs to add under Appendix 2(a): "The detailed description of their policies and measures to implement their commitments under Article 4

" The UK, supported by Denmark and the US, said the language would be more suitable in the decision on national communications

 The Chair directed that paragraph 1(a) of Appendix II be written as a separate decision and that the US and Philippines consult on 1(e)

 The G-77 and China said that there are varying capabilities among developing countries and that it would be difficult to subject them to a format

 Germany suggested that provisional guidelines could be adopted to guarantee comparability, with longer term guidelines to be adopted at COP-2

 Algeria said that many developing countries need strengthened capacities to gather statistics

 India suggested renewing the developing countries" commitment to develop a guidelines after COP-1

 The G-77, supported by China, Colombia and Algeria, stated that the idea is to enable developing countries, not to provide technology alone

 Colombia commented that this issue was a problem for other conventions, none of which have agreed on the means of implementation

 China suggested that the Secretariat develop an inventory of technology transferable at no cost, and Algeria requested that the Secretariat develop practical means for implementing technology transfer for COP-1

 The G-77 and China stated a preference for a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and proposed an amendment for paragraph 25 on amounts of funding

 Venezuela, Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia protested and insisted that their amendments be included in brackets

<p> RULE 54 " LANGUAGES: Japan proposed that the official languages of the COP should be English, French and Spanish

 The Committee"s report to the COP will also reflect that: the Committee noted the agreement between the Interim Secretariat and Germany for the COP; heads of organizations have been invited to speak; and the Committee has requested the Secretariat to draft the provisional agenda for COP-1

 The EU, Japan and Australia expressed doubts about bringing this matter before the ACABQ

 Australia and New Zealand supported setting aside Secretariat funds for the IPCC

 Germany said the two protocols deserved reference

 <p> China proposed: "Many countries emphasize that the full implementation of existing commitments under the Convention is the most important step that developed country Parties should take at this stage

" Australia, supported by the US, felt that this was not consistent with the rest of the document since it was a selective representation of views

 The Chair suggested amending China"s proposal to read, "Emphasizing that

" Kuwait and Mali disagreed

 France argued against including opinions that lacked consensus

" The Russian Federation, supported by the EU, China and Kuwait, said this proposal was completely unacceptable because it would cast doubt on the use of all six languages and revise a standard UN practice

 The Russian Federation added that if Japan insisted on including this provision, it would propose bracketing the entire document

30 from the G-77 and China, A/AC

<p> The Contact Group discussing the physical location of the Permanent Secretariat met Thursday afternoon with the representatives of the four countries offering to host the Secretariat — Canada, Germany, Switzerland and Uruguay

 The location of the Permanent Secretariat remains pending, although the four countries offering to host the Secretariat (Canada, Germany, Switzerland and Uruguay) have been asked to negotiate among themselves so that a single nomination is presented to the COP in Berlin

 Later in the week, it was announced that the regional groups had nominated their candidates for the Bureau, including: India, Japan, Mauritania, Zimbabwe, the Russian Federation, Hungary, Argentina and Antigua and Barbuda, Germany, Australia and Samoa

 The Committee's report will also reflect the following: the Committee noted the agreement between the Interim Secretariat and Germany for the COP; heads of organizations have been invited to speak; and the Committee has requested the Secretariat to draft the provisional agenda for COP-1

 It was later announced that the instruments of ratification had been received from Kiribati and Lesotho (7 February 1995) and Oman (8 February 1995), bringing the total to 121 States and the EEC

 Benin recommended establishing a floor as well as a ceiling for contributions from the Parties

 Japan and the US asked questions about the voluntary nature of contributions

 Canada explained that Toronto is a leader in environmental protection and a multicultural city well suited to host the Secretariat

 Switzerland said that the choice for the Secretariat's location should be based on effectiveness, not finance or prestige, and that Geneva, as a UN center, would be the most effective

 Canada added that the logic of the Contact Group's report is that if a city is not a UN center, it should not apply

 <p> By the conclusion of the session, the Contact Group was unable to make a recommendation and asked Canada, Germany, Switzerland and Uruguay to hold consultations among themselves before COP-1 to facilitate a decision on the issue

 In addition, Japan raised concern once again with Rule 54 (Languages)

 The EU, Fiji, Australia, Kenya, Benin and the UK, while sympathetic, worried about setting a precedent

 The US, the EU, Australia, Canada and New Zealand objected to this proposal because there are many categories of special needs countries, besides AOSIS (which has had a seat on the INC Bureau), and opening the Bureau to one will require opening it to the others

 <p> Venezuela, Kuwait, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Iran, China and Zaire preferred Alternative B in A/AC

 The EU, Australia, Japan, Canada, Czech Republic, Brazil, Switzerland, South Africa and Slovakia expressed favor for Alternative A, provided that a decision to adopt a protocol would be taken by a 3/4 majority

 Trinidad and Tobago (on behalf of AOSIS) the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Micronesia, Norway, Mauritius, Solomon Islands and Cuba preferred Alternative A, provided that protocols are adopted by consensus or, as a last resort, a 2/3 majority vote

 <p> Rule 54 — Languages: Japan proposed that the official languages of the COP should be English, French and Spanish

 During the final Plenary discussion on this matter, Japan proposed instead that Rule 54 remain unaltered, but that a second paragraph or a footnote should be included stating, "The lack of documentation or interpretation in any these languages due to budgetary constraints shall not interrupt the smooth proceeding of COP and its subsidiary bodies

" The Russian Federation, supported by the EU, China and Kuwait, said this proposal was unacceptable

 The EU, supported by Germany, Switzerland and Canada, proposed a working group to address budgetary matters and asked that it review both the 1995 and 1996/97 budgets

 Saudi Arabia, supported by Kuwait, Iran and Nigeria, said that the pilot phase of JI should be limited to Annex I Parties

 Chile accepted the idea of a pilot phase with a certain percentage of credits for developed and developing countries

 The EU, Japan, Australia and the US supported use of global warming potentials (GWPs)

 Australia said countries should have flexibility in applying their own guidelines if they were comparable to those of the IPCC

 Japan said non-Annex I Parties could apply the IPCC guidelines

 China said the IPCC guidelines were too complicated for developing countries, who should develop their own simplified guidelines

 The G-77 and China said that the SBSTA should work out guidelines for the IPCC report and that the SBSTA should not be subordinated to the SBI

 Kuwait and Saudi Arabia suggested adding socioeconomic reviews to scientific and technical considerations by SBSTA

 The G-77 and China said the number of meetings of the subsidiary bodies should be limited to save money and permit participation of developing countries

<p> The G-77 and China proposal (A/AC

<p> The Philippines, on behalf of the G-77 and China, noted that JI should not allow for the shifting of specific commitments of Annex I Parties to developing countries

 China suggested that the Secretariat develop an inventory of technology transferable free of costs, but many developed country Parties objected that this was premature

 The Philippines, on behalf of the G-77 and China, said that they do not want to eliminate any of the six languages in Rule 54

 <p> The Rapporteur, Maciej Sadowski (Poland) then introduced the draft report, as contained in A/AC

 Algeria, China, Kuwait, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Benin did not agree with listing the number of countries in favor of each alternative in Rule 42 (Voting)

 India, supported by Venezuela, proposed replacing "22 countries" and "eight countries" with "some countries

 Since the consensus was to maintain the "conservative lack of transparency," he said that the text will be revised, as proposed by India

<p> The Rapporteur, Maciej Sadowski (Poland) then introduced the draft report, as contained in A/AC

<p> During the first week of INC-11, Trinidad and Tobago, on behalf of AOSIS, introduced a draft protocol submitted in September 1994, and Germany also introduced a proposal for further elements of a protocol

" The G-77 and China repeatedly refuted the possible implication of the proposal, which would extend their commitments and/or create a new class of developing countries

 Initially only some developing countries expressed support for the AOSIS draft protocol while OPEC countries and China said that protocol negotiations were premature since neither the best available scientific information nor the review of Annex I Parties communications provided a sufficient basis for negotiations

 The procedural compromise was that the proposals of the G-77 and China, the EU and the US will be transmitted to the COP for further consideration

 Practical, financial and political considerations have all come into play as delegates listened to the offers from Canada (Toronto), Germany (Bonn), Switzerland (Geneva) and Uruguay (Montevideo)

 Delegates were unable to take action on the adequacy of commitments or to begin negotiations on a draft protocol submitted by AOSIS or the proposals for further elements of a protocol submitted by Germany

<p> At a press conference on Monday, 27 March 1995, the Executive-Secretary, Michael Zammit Cutajar, remarked that not only was this the biggest UN event to be held in Germany, but it was the biggest event for the Convention

 In addition, the EC has sent an overview, Belgium has provided a summary, and Liechtenstein (not an Annex I Party) has sent in a national communication

 COP-1 will consider and take "appropriate action" on the draft protocol submitted by Trinidad and Tobago, on behalf of AOSIS, and the proposals for further elements of a protocol submitted by Germany

 Kuwait and Saudi Arabia expressed difficulty with Rule 22 on composition of the Bureau

<p> Chair of the INC/FCCC: Ra�l Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) said that the work of the INC and the Interim Secretariat had contributed to a legally-binding machinery, including reports on measures adopted at curbing emissions and setting in motion the entity or entities which will operate the financial mechanism

 <p> Uruguay said the Interim Secretariat"s budget estimates did not reflect differences in potential operating costs for the different proposals for the location of the Permanent Secretariat, which should be taken into account

 He suggested that the estimates include more than the transfer costs of locating the Permanent Secretariat, and added that he could not support the sections on Uruguay in the Interim Secretariat"s documents

 India was willing to adopt the indicative scale of contributions outlined in the Interim Secretariat"s document and asked whether proposed consultations had occurred between the countries offering to host the Permanent Secretariat

 Canada said the budget figures Uruguay mentioned had not been distributed, but should be as soon as possible

 <p> The Executive-Secretary responded that the cost figures referred to by Uruguay appeared only in a draft document and could be improved upon in any final document

 <p> Argentina supported the AOSIS protocol and German elements paper and called for protocol negotiations

 Australia expressed surprise about comments that it is blocking progress and noted its long-standing track record as an active, committed participant in these negotiations

 <p> China said a majority of States is not yet ready to negotiate a protocol

1, which contains the text of proposals tabled at INC-11 by the G-77 and China, the EU and the US

 <p> The Philippines, on behalf of the G-77 and China, reiterated points contained in their proposal, including the application of emission limits to only Annex I Parties and the distinction between joint activities and joint implementation

 <p> Bangladesh said single-country initiatives should not be crowded out or overshadowed by JI

 Indonesia said that joint activities between developed and developing countries should be based on national priorities of the recipient country and facilitate the transfer of technology and financial resources

 China expressed confusion over tradable rights and other new ideas

 <p> Brazil strongly opposed JI and added that his delegation did not want to exchange 'smoke for trees

' India said a pilot phase could be launched if no credits were allocated

 Mali said that a JI pilot phase should be extended to cover developing countries, but developed countries should not assume a reduction of their commitments

 Helmut Kohl, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, urged delegates to remember the lessons of the Berlin, noting that never again must 'walls of enmity' be erected between peoples, nations and States

 Small island developing States, such as Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Samoa, Vanuatu, Micronesia, Mauritius, Jamaica and the Maldives, emphasized their vulnerability to the effects of climate change, particularly sea level rise

 Many African States, including Botswana, Nigeria, Chad, C“te d'Ivoire, Benin, Lesotho, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Mauritania, Senegal, Tunisia, Togo, Mozambique, Morocco and the Central African Republic, stressed the link between climate change and other problems, such as desertification and extreme poverty, and called for technology transfer and financial assistance

 <p> India said the decision to launch a process to strengthen the commitments made COP- 1 a success, noting that consultations were not easy

 <p> Papua New Guinea stated that the biggest disappointment was the waiting game that developing States must play in adoption of the AOSIS protocol

 <p> Venezuela expressed disappointment that major positions have not been reflected in the document

 He stated that Venezuela is determined to continue fostering measures that will help preserve the environment, and placed a reservation on the decision

 <p> Kuwait found this document did not satisfy the Convention's requirements as a country with special needs under Article 4

 <p> Mauritius said his delegation did not have very much to be proud of, and will leave Berlin with a sense of sadness for having something that is 'half-baked

 <p> Malaysia shared the disappointment of AOSIS and said the language is as ambiguous as the original commitments adopted in 1992

 <p> The Maldives said small island States have been marginalized, sidelined and totally bypassed in some of the decisions

 After a number of formal statements from Latin American countries, with the notable exception of Brazil, that favored a JI pilot phase with the participation of non- Annex I countries, it appeared as though a number of Asian countries soon followed suit

 OPEC countries and China said that the protocol negotiations were premature since neither the best available scientific information nor the review of Annex I Parties' communications provided a sufficient basis for negotiations

 <p> Upon arrival in Berlin, the most notable shift in position was that of India

 Rather than opposing negotiations towards a protocol as it had in the past, India stepped forward and took the lead within the G-77 by preparing the first draft decision on the adequacy of commitments

 When the G-77 and China could not endorse the Indian proposal, the meeting adjourned and, instead, India convened a meeting of like-minded States

 Certain OECD countries, including the US and Australia, could not endorse the AOSIS protocol as the basis for future negotiations because of the targets, timetables and the focus on CO2 emissions rather than GHG emissions as a whole

 <p> The US and Australia, to name a few developed countries, seemed to be pleased with the outcome

 Echoing this thought, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Kuwait placed official reservations on the document since it did not satisfy their requirements as countries with special conditions recognized by Article 4

<p> Upon arrival in Berlin, the most notable shift in position was that of India

<p> The US and Australia, to name a few developed countries, seemed to be pleased with the outcome

 While these negotiations are crucial for the period beyond the year 2000, one cannot overlook the fact that most Annex I Parties, with the exception of the Netherlands and the Czech Republic, are not on the road to meeting existing commitments

 Uruguay has offered to host COP-2, which will take place by October 1996

 Raul Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina), noted that this meeting marked the beginning of a new phase in the life of the Convention, consolidating all of its past work and achievements

 The PHILIPPINES, on behalf of the G-77 and China, expressed concern over the lack of funding for this meeting, which limited the participation of developing countries and could be detrimental to the process itself

 GERMANY stated that it would make a considerable contribution towards facilitating the participation of developing countries

 <p> SPAIN, on behalf of the EU, recalled that according to the BM, the early stage of the AGBM process includes analysis and assessment but also includes negotiations in parallel

 <p> INDIA said that it had been agreed in Berlin that the existing commitments of Annex I Parties are inadequate and need to be strengthened

" <p> SWITZERLAND said that the BM clearly states that analysis and assessments should be conducted in parallel and not prior to the negotiations

 AUSTRALIA stressed the importance of analyses and assessments for Annex I Parties and said that it should not be narrowed to particular prescriptive assumptions

 <p> CANADA enquired about the exact intent of the aim to elaborate policies and measures as well as to set quantified limitation reduction objectives

 GERMANY stated its intention to work towards a negotiating process that leads to an ambitious protocol or legal instrument on the further reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for adoption by COP 3

 She said that Germany would make contributions to facilitate developing country participation

 ARGENTINA stressed its support for the G-77 and China statement and said that the analyses and assessments should proceed "side-by-side" with negotiations

 BANGLADESH said that the AGBM should not renegotiate the BM but negotiate targets and timetables applicable to Annex I Parties commitments

 JAPAN said that it would consider the ideas contained in the U

 non-paper and supported the timetable for work suggested by Switzerland

 COLOMBIA indicated that there should be no new commitments for non-Annex I Parties

 MALAYSIA noted that the AGBM needed to set a clear course so as not to divert from the review of the adequacy of commitments for Annex I Parties

 CHILE expressed dismay that discussions appeared to be moving backward rather than forward

 BRAZIL said the major tasks of this group are to decide collectively on overall emissions and to apply the concept of common but differentiated responsibility

 KUWAIT disagreed with the EU, noting that this Convention was more far-reaching that the Montreal Protocol, and required a more "open-minded" process

 The NETHERLANDS stated that the key issues are clearly spelled out in the BM, and that assessments and analysis should not be used to determine whether policies and measures are needed

 <p> VENEZUELA said that any action undertaken by Annex I Parties to reduce emissions will affect the economies of developing countries, and that any assessments should include these effects

 JAPAN suggested that work should be carried out in light of the best available scientific information, and that the SBSTA and SBI should play important roles

 POLAND supported the statement made by the Russian Federation, and stated that the AGBM should ask SBSTA to analyze national policy actions based on national communications and OECD/IEA work

 CHINA noted that the word "inputs" appeared to have many different interpretations

 <p> AUSTRALIA stated that climate change is a global problem and that the actions taken by Annex I Parties had implications for developing countries

 NIGERIA said that the one salient point that recurred throughout the discussion was that analysis and assessment activities were central to the AGBM process

 <p> PERU felt that the basic aspects being discussed regarding inputs are: priority criterion; a "middle of the road" stance as to whether analysis and assessments should occur simultaneously with negotiations; information on the economic impacts for developing countries of Annex I Parties adopting emissions reductions, and the definition of the Parties' positions with regard to contributions

 NORWAY supported the Netherlands and commented that the IPCC was the key body for giving technical and scientific advice

 COLOMBIA commented that inputs are a key element of the BM and that the AGBM must be clear about time frames

 She supported comments made by Peru, and noted that the only way to achieve the goal of the Convention was to move forward in all areas

 GERMANY stated that apparently considerable doubt remained on the German position, in light of comments by China

 FRANCE supported the EU and emphasized the need not to delay until the end of the process to embark upon negotiations

 MAURITIUS said the BM is precise, and contains a clear direction and mandate

 Supporting Norway, he said that an active role for IPCC would prove fruitful

 BANGLADESH, supporting Germany, stated that the AGBM must start negotiations on policies and measures for Annex I parties, and added that analysis and assessment could be done simultaneously

 SPAIN, on behalf of the EU, mentioned four necessary elements for the agenda: structure and possible elements for the contents of the Protocol; methodology on drafting the Protocol; consideration of the inputs received; and, further work for the AGBM, such as setting deadlines for proposed inputs on objectives and time horizons

 <p> SAUDI ARABIA, supported by KUWAIT, stressed the need to concentrate on analysis and assessment activities during AGBM 2, and questioned whether negotiations could proceed in absence of adequate information

 The PHILIPPINES, on behalf of the G-77 and CHINA, stated that the G-77 was still discussing this issue

 SWITZERLAND suggested that their proposals to establish technical advisory panels, along with prioritized topics for work, could be addressed in upcoming session

 NIGERIA, supporting both the G-77 and China and Saudi Arabia, said that he would hold the Chair to his promise of reviewing sources of information

<p> SPAIN, on behalf of the EU, recalled that according to the BM, the early stage of the AGBM process includes analysis and assessment but also includes negotiations in parallel

<p> INDIA said that it had been agreed in Berlin that the existing commitments of Annex I Parties are inadequate and need to be strengthened

<p> SWITZERLAND said that the BM clearly states that analysis and assessments should be conducted in parallel and not prior to the negotiations

 <p> JAPAN said developed countries must take the lead on implementation, inventories and communications

 <p> PERU has completed its inventory with assistance from the US, but it will be difficult to continue commitments under Article 4

 <p> BRAZIL invited international coordination to complete its inventory, noting that the most uncertainty in IPCC projections is in deforestation and that it has more than one-third of the world's tropical forests

 <p> EGYPT said work to address climate change was currently underway and added that commitments from developed countries were an essential component to its continuation

 <p> SPAIN, on behalf of the EU, said the text of the BM must be the starting point for future work, and added that the process will not include any new commitments

 <p> SPAIN, on behalf of the EU, presented a proposal on a possible protocol structure based on three principles: consistency with the BM, consistency with the Convention and the need for a dynamic instrument

 <p> The US, supported by Malaysia, said that the AGBM is still some distance away from a final text, and suggested that an agreement to modify the Convention could achieve the goal of a protocol without an elaborate legal instrument

 <p> AUSTRALIA stated that any protocol must address all GHGs, sources and sinks in a comprehensive manner, must address all elements in the BM in practical implementation measures, and must reflect the interlinking nature of the features and aims of the BM

 <p> ARGENTINA supported employing annexes for additional policies and measures

 <p> NORWAY supported Australia on comprehensiveness, saying the commitments should cover all GHGs, sinks and sources

 <p> CHINA said discussion should be on substantive issues, not the structure of a legal instrument, and that China is flexible on the form of instrument

 <p> ICELAND said the EU outline could be a point of departure

 Iceland prefers a combined overall emissions goal including sinks rather than gas-by-gas targets

 JAPAN said clarifying scientific and technical issues, through a review of Annex I activities and quantitative assessment of their effects, would provide guidance to form a protocol

 BANGLADESH supported the AOSIS protocol with the German elements paper as the basis of the exchange of views

 EGYPT said the protocol should deal only with new commitments, while the reaffirmation of existing commitments remains a COP concern

 PERU asked whether the second compilation will be ready by the tentative date

 The US stated that the document failed to mentioned an administrative official whose services were supplied by the US, and CANADA pledged to contribute C$65,000

 <p> SBSTA Chair Tibor Farago (Hungary) reported on negotiations to establish technical advisory panels (TAPs)

 A number of delegations asked that the paragraph be replaced by a reference to a G-77 and China position paper

 The paragraph on the forum was amended to include consultations between the AGBM Chair and the Chair of the G-77 and China

 Atiq Rahman, Director of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies, then spoke on behalf of the environmental NGOs

<p> SBSTA Chair Tibor Farago (Hungary) reported on negotiations to establish technical advisory panels (TAPs)

 Switzerland, Russia, Norway, Japan, Poland, Canada and Australia supported or expanded on various aspects of the US position

 Switzerland said different targets could be designed for different categories and shared by regional "clusters" of countries

 Russia suggested dividing countries by regional or socioeconomic characteristics, possibly writing separate regional protocols for each

 The Netherlands, Canada, the US, Australia and Peru were among those proposing possible criteria

 Argentina, Burkina Faso and New Zealand noted that these ideas were useful

 OPEC countries, China and others continued to suggest that consideration of a protocol or structure was premature before additional analysis and assessment

 <p> To advance present commitments of non-Annex I Parties, Malaysia proposed establishing a panel of experts from developing countries to design simplified inventory and national communication procedures

 The proposal gained broad support from developing country Parties and became the subject of a G-77 and China position paper

<p> To advance present commitments of non-Annex I Parties, Malaysia proposed establishing a panel of experts from developing countries to design simplified inventory and national communication procedures

<p> SBSTA Chair Tibor Farago (Hungary) opened the second session of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) by noting the tight schedule and the need for SBSTA's work to feed into the second Conference of Parties (COP-2) as well as into the work of other subsidiary bodies, especially the <i>Ad Hoc</i> Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM)

 <p> In his opening statement, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar said seven countries had become Parties to the Convention since 3 November 1995: Bhutan, Djibouti, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Honduras, Mozambique, and Nicaragua

 Nine others have ratified or acceded and will become Parties soon: Belgium, Cambodia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Morocco, Slovenia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen

 He recommended beginning informal consultations under Diego Malpede (Argentina), toward consideration of a document later in the week

<p> In his opening statement, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar said seven countries had become Parties to the Convention since 3 November 1995: Bhutan, Djibouti, Ghana, Guinea Bissau, Honduras, Mozambique, and Nicaragua

 ITALY, on behalf of the EU, said assessment of technologies and methods for estimating the effects of measures have not been properly addressed

 <p> IRAN, on behalf of the Asian Group, said the Chair's proposal on the number of TAPs is acceptable, but no consensus on distribution of panel members exists

 NIGERIA said the African Group supported the Chair's paper

 The PHILIPPINES, coordinator of G-77/China on this issue, recalled that her group had entered these negotiations with a solid position, but had moved from it to accommodate the process

 SLOVENIA supported the Philippines on the TAPs and agreed with the US on the NGO intervention

 The PHILIPPINES said the G-77/China's understanding of balance seems to be at odds with the other groups

 <p> INDIA said that the SBSTA should take regional groups as the basis, and noted that Asia has both Annex I and non-Annex I countries

 <p> AUSTRALIA stressed the need to deliver the work plan for the technical experts

 <p> GERMANY reminded delegates this was the first phase of experimentation that could lead to a more permanent institutional structure

<p> IRAN, on behalf of the Asian Group, said the Chair's proposal on the number of TAPs is acceptable, but no consensus on distribution of panel members exists

<p> GERMANY reminded delegates this was the first phase of experimentation that could lead to a more permanent institutional structure

 SWITZERLAND noted the IPCC report provides a clear signal, but added that mitigation measures are available and many will cost little

 MALAYSIA asked whether the climate models will have a global or regional basis

 BRAZIL said the SBSTA can make recommendations to the COP to endorse areas the IPCC identified to promote governmental and international action to fill knowledge gaps

 AUSTRALIA noted the number of "no regrets" policies, but said the risk of damage provides rationale for actions beyond "no regrets

 IRAN said the SAR provided an opportunity to consider socioeconomic impacts, technology transfer and policy measures for sustainable economic growth

 <p> ZIMBABWE highlighted the result that developing countries are the most heavily affected and have less adaptation options regarding food, water and human health

 Supported by KENYA and POLAND, she said there is a need to get information to all levels of society and to improve regional participation using local experts

 NIGERIA said the SAR is a preliminary document that the IPCC will continue to develop

 JAPAN highlighted: substantial evidence that warming is occurring; the requirement for future emissions lower than 1990 levels, if concentrations are to stabilize; the suggestion that a significant amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be reduced at small or negligible cost; that diffusion of technology is vital; and that while scientific uncertainty still exists, the possibly huge impact requires action according to the precautionary principle

 <p> CHINA asked whether the SAR's impact assessments were based on the latest projections of mean global surface temperature increase or earlier, higher projections

 CANADA urged the SBSTA to endorse the SAR and bring it to the COP for action

 He placed priority on public dissemination and said impacts on unmanaged water, permafrost regions and boreal forests would impact Canada

 <p> KUWAIT said agreement on the need to reduce uncertainty means that uncertainty exists

 The PHILIPPINES appreciated the report's acknowledgment that developing countries are going to suffer from the adverse effects of climate change

 KENYA said the report does not say which concentrations could be dangerous and asked if this represented a scientific fact or a policy position

 The US, supported by POLAND, said it would be better to use exact IPCC wording because the SAR is a negotiated text

 Supported by CHINA, KUWAIT and NIGERIA, he added that the SBSTA should only thank the IPCC for its assessment and transmit the synthesis report and the SAR to the COP

 NIGERIA said the conclusions should reflect that the IPCC report is not the only report available

 CHINA said a reference to the IPCC report as "the most authoritative and comprehensive assessment available" should be changed to "useful and comprehensive

 NORWAY said paragraph 2 is not a biased selection and supported its inclusion

 CANADA said the SBSTA must identify key findings in the SAR if it is to provide appropriate advice to the AGBM and the COP

 KENYA supported retention of paragraph 2 using IPCC language

 AUSTRALIA supported retaining the reference to "most authoritative and comprehensive" as well as paragraph 2

 Saudi Arabia, China, Costa Rica, on behalf of the G-77/China, Iran, Venezuela, India and Kuwait said that developing countries did not have the time to analyze the SAR and that the list of highlights would bias the SBSTA's conclusions against those countries that did not have the opportunity to evaluate the report

 Switzerland, Norway, the US, the UK, the Marshall Islands, Uzbekistan, and Trinidad and Tobago, on behalf of AOSIS, supported including a list, noting that the SBSTA should indicate that the SAR had important messages for policy makers

 China, the US and Trinidad and Tobago supported the Chair's suggestion to move the highlights to the report

 Saudi Arabia, supported by China, said the report would need to reflect the views of delegations that believe the highlights are selective and out of context

" <p> COOPERATION WITH THE IPCC: In the morning of Wednesday, 28 February, SBSTA Vice-Chair Soobaraj Nayroo Sok Appadu (Mauritius) opened discussions on scientific cooperation

 The US, supported by UZBEKISTAN, said IPCC technical reports should address a variety of gas mixes, time horizons and stabilization levels, use simple models to predict mean temperature change and sea-level rise at 10-year intervals, and evaluate the technical feasibility of each profile

 The NETHERLANDS said the documents are already made for policy makers, so there is no need for further simplification of IPCC documents by the SBSTA

 <p> INDIA said the IPCC should continue to synthesize science and technical research, not stray into policy measures or national technologies

 He supported regional workshops, with an Asian regional meeting in India

 VENEZUELA said the IPCC should look at the social and economic consequences of a protocol or legal instrument of new commitments for Annex I countries and how new commitments can help avoid temperature and sea-level rise

 CHINA said global projections alone are far from enough for countries and regions to formulate policies and strategies

 UGANDA said the question is how SBI and SBSTA can establish regional research institutions, especially in less developed areas like Africa

 ITALY, on behalf of the EU, said the IPCC should continue as the primary body providing independent assessments, reviewing published literature and developing methodologies and guidelines

 <p> KUWAIT said it is important to focus on the economic impacts of any proposals for new commitments, and on the reduction in change in temperature and sea-level rise that can be achieved

 CANADA supported looking at criteria for determining dangerous interference, as well as emphasis on social and economic impacts, especially in developing countries, and on the impact of response options on employment, inflation and other economic factors

 MALAYSIA recommended that SBSTA prepare a list of adaptation technologies and consider mechanisms to enhance dissemination of experience on adaptation technology

 EGYPT said the IPCC should continue to assess impacts on vulnerable regions

 <p> POLAND said guidelines for adaptation measures are needed as well as for inventories

 ARMENIA called for a study of methane emissions from municipal dumps and work on the use of municipal refuse as fuel

<p> ZIMBABWE highlighted the result that developing countries are the most heavily affected and have less adaptation options regarding food, water and human health

<p> CHINA asked whether the SAR's impact assessments were based on the latest projections of mean global surface temperature increase or earlier, higher projections

<p> KUWAIT said agreement on the need to reduce uncertainty means that uncertainty exists

<p> COOPERATION WITH THE IPCC: In the morning of Wednesday, 28 February, SBSTA Vice-Chair Soobaraj Nayroo Sok Appadu (Mauritius) opened discussions on scientific cooperation

<p> INDIA said the IPCC should continue to synthesize science and technical research, not stray into policy measures or national technologies

<p> KUWAIT said it is important to focus on the economic impacts of any proposals for new commitments, and on the reduction in change in temperature and sea-level rise that can be achieved

<p> POLAND said guidelines for adaptation measures are needed as well as for inventories

 <p> INDIA noted the projected values for emissions of all GHGs are substantially higher than 1990 levels, and fall far short of the Convention's goals

 JAPAN highlighted the need to clearly define the time frame for prospective steps in the guidelines, which should review the performance of policies and measures and should be more comparable

 POLAND said that economies in transition may have trouble submitting national inventory data by 15 April 1996

 CANADA supported the further development of guidelines to improve transparency, consistency, descriptions of policies and measures, and reporting on technology cooperation

 AUSTRALIA supported the Secretariat's proposal to include examples of national circumstances in the second compilation

 URUGUAY expressed concern about the lack of comparability between Annex I national communications

 <p> CHINA, supported by the PHILIPPINES, said no one other than the G-77/China could change the group's position paper

 INDIA said financial support would also be needed for institutional capacity building, including monitoring and research and development for measurement systems

 NIGERIA emphasized the importance of technical capacity building through training and other necessary financial assistance

 ITALY, on behalf of the EU, said the description of policies and measures should include a section on mitigation

 FRANCE asked whether the 1994 base year should be different than Annex I Parties' base year of 1990, and also suggested that aggregation of reports from non-Annex I Parties did not preclude the need to collect or analyze individual countries' reports

 JAPAN said the variety of conditions in developing countries requires flexibility without compromising other values

 CANADA said guidelines should be finalized for recommendation to COP-2 and for early application by some Parties

 INDIA said transparency, comparability and consistency are requirements of science and of all Parties, but are not totally apparent even in Annex I Parties' communications

 CHINA said no Party had achieved transparency, comparability, and consistency, and asked whether is it fair to hold developing countries to standards others have not met

 <p> The PHILIPPINES said flexibility does not mean that Parties pick and choose obligations, but the goal is to deal with difficulties

 MALAYSIA said delegates should not prejudge transparency, comparability and consistency until the SBSTA can evaluate the communications

<p> INDIA noted the projected values for emissions of all GHGs are substantially higher than 1990 levels, and fall far short of the Convention's goals

<p> CHINA, supported by the PHILIPPINES, said no one other than the G-77/China could change the group's position paper

 <p> The NETHERLANDS, on behalf of the OECD, reported on the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI), which was established to assist all interested countries in meeting the objectives of the UNFCCC

 INDIA mentioned several other sources of information available, including databases and newsletters, and highlighted the importance of electronic information technology

 <p> MALAYSIA said it is difficult to make full use of the data available

 JAPAN highlighted activities under the CTI and AIJ

 He highlighted the Fifth Asian-Pacific seminar on climate change in Sendai, Japan (23-25 January 1996) and noted the proposals presented, including the formulation of inventories, the use of local and regional centers, and technology transfer

 CANADA said the highest priority is preparing national communications, and supported annual reports on technology assessments

 <p> CHINA disagreed with the suggestion that technology transfer should be linked with AIJ, because AIJ is supplementary and voluntary, whereas technology transfer is an obligation

 <p> IRAN stated that this information should be produced in a manner that covers the demand of countries

<p> The NETHERLANDS, on behalf of the OECD, reported on the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI), which was established to assist all interested countries in meeting the objectives of the UNFCCC

<p> IRAN stated that this information should be produced in a manner that covers the demand of countries

 CANADA requested that the Secretariat prepare a document on a longer-term programme

 MALAYSIA said the Secretariat should consider how the SBSTA would provide advice on international research programmes, and research and observation systems

 Following the Chair's suggestion to adopt the draft report of SBSTA, CHINA and VENEZUELA objected and made proposals for including specific elements, but the Chair replied that the group was only adopting the structure of report without the substantive elements at this stage, and that all issues would be considered later in the day

 <p> CHINA proposed including a paragraph noting the G-77/China's position paper on guidelines for preparing initial communications from non-Annex I Parties

" TRINIDAD and TOBAGO supported China and proposed references to the AOSIS statement throughout the report

 The US questioned including a reference to a position paper, but China insisted the inclusion was its sovereign right

 The PHILIPPINES requested more time to review the document

 CHINA suggested highlighting transfer of technology and proposed adding a paragraph on Annex II Parties' activities on technology transfer

 <p> MALAYSIA said its proposal had been omitted and added a reference to setting up a one-stop information center, providing financial resources, preparing comprehensive catalogues, disseminating information and assessing the suitability of technology

 INDIA proposed adding a paragraph stating that the SBSTA adopted this document as the basis of guidelines and format for preparation of the initial communications from non-Annex I Parties

 The PHILIPPINES said the proposal intends to send a clear message for further planning and discussion

 <p> GHANA, on behalf of the African Group, expressed disappointment that guidelines for non-Annex I communications were not adopted and that no contact group was established to resolve differences between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties

 CHINA, the EU and the US debated at length proposed language on methods for and calculation of an outcome of the contribution of AIJ projects, with China arguing for removal of "methods

 The PHILIPPINES said the list of major IPCC findings should include adverse effects of climate change, including adaptation and mitigation

 JAPAN said the highlights should mention technical measures that accelerate technology diffusion and transfer

 GHANA, on behalf of the African Group, expressed disappointment at the inability to reach agreement

 <p> The PHILIPPINES said it was not the G-77/China that blocked establishment of the TAPs

 CHINA said the G-77/China paper reflects the serious effort made to facilitate a decision

 <p> JAPAN regretted the lack of decision on TAPs and suggested considering initiating a process with a roster of experts

 Delegates discussed this suggestion, and URUGUAY said the Secretariat could prepare a paper on relevant disciplines for the TAPs

<p> CHINA proposed including a paragraph noting the G-77/China's position paper on guidelines for preparing initial communications from non-Annex I Parties

 SENEGAL said technical and financial support was vital for non-Annex I Parties' preparation of preliminary national communications

 IRAN said that an over-emphasis on long-term activities must not undermine the short-term activities in developing countries

 <p> INDIA noted that national communications are not just part of a process, but are a basis for sustainable development

 CHINA stressed the need for more financial resources and said that activities should not be confined to information exchange and training, but should provide technical and financial support

 SWITZERLAND stated, on the objective of eliminating obstacles, that care must be used to ensure that all actions are acceptable

 <p> BRAZIL noted the commitment to provide financial resources but said that no resources had been received to date

 PANAMA called for more information on activities so that Parties are not dependent on second-hand news

 CANADA and GERMANY noted the importance of electronic dissemination of information and encouraged further expansion

 He also noted, as the EU and Brazil stated, that national communications are not a one-time event

 As for China and Senegal's call to speed up the process, the Secretariat said a "jump start" is close to "short-circuit," but CC:FORUM is designed to help

 SAUDI ARABIA objected to the reference to the adoption of the operational strategy, but FRANCE stated that the phrase was essential

<p> INDIA noted that national communications are not just part of a process, but are a basis for sustainable development

 VENEZUELA asked whether the group should open this debate and said there will be a Bureau meeting in due course

 MALI endorsed the comments of Senegal and asked if the rules of procedure can be indefinitely extended

 URUGUAY said there were no criteria on whether the Chairs of the subsidiary bodies has to sit on the Bureau and asked if there had been any progress on the rules of procedure concerning the composition of Bureau with 10 or 11 members

 NIGERIA said if the Bureau is to be expanded the African Group will make its own request because it has the most members

 The NETHERLANDS noted that the SBSTA refers to the G-77/China document as the basis for adoption, whereas this proposal refers to it as the basis for implementation

 INDIA said the G-77/China proposal provides more details and places the SBSTA's work in the context of implementation

 <p> The PHILIPPINES said the G-77/China wanted to tailor a response to the SBI

" The G-77/China, the US and India continued to discuss the language in a small group

 <p> The Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), Mahmoud Ould El Gaouth (Mauritania), reported on the conclusions of the SBI meeting

 NIGERIA recalled that Bolin had said, during SBSTA, that there were uncertainties inherent in the SAR

 CANADA supported the findings in the first set of SBSTA conclusions and noted that they seemed to have the support of most Parties

 JAPAN supported the SAR findings and said specific P&amp;M should be clarified

 <p> POLICIES AND MEASURES: Chow Kok Kee (Malaysia) summarized an informal workshop on policies and measures (P&amp;M) held on 4-5 March 1996

 <p> CANADA reported on the Annex I experts group project on P&amp;M for common action, which is developing a methodology for evaluating their effectiveness

 ITALY, on behalf of the EU, said the EU has begun investigating 11 areas of P&amp;M, identifying indicators, evaluating targets, and assessing emission reductions toward a study for AGBM 4

 <p> CHILE supported Germany’s proposed approach for a flat rate emissions reduction, noting it contained clear measures and was aimed at CO2 emissions without precluding other instruments

 AUSTRALIA said P&amp;M in a legal instrument should complement national programmes

 <p> CANADA said the IPCC SAR suggests that significant opportunities are available for Parties to take actions, so it is important to identify P&amp;M that reinforce the positive relationship between economics and the environment, such as energy efficiency and pollution controls

 <p> SWITZERLAND said fluorocarbons and HFCs should be included as a sector, as a possible growing source of emissions that are persistent in atmosphere compared to other gases

 <p> The NETHERLANDS said there are reasons for harmonizing P&amp;M because some measures cannot be taken at the national level without distorting the global market

 IRAN said the AGBM should cooperate with the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Energy Agency (IEA), OPEC, UNIDO and others to assess which P&amp;M are effective and efficient

 ICELAND said differentiated commitments can imply a more complicated agreement, but reduction targets are possible in a more cost-effective manner if different national circumstances are recognized

 UGANDA said Annex I countries must take seriously their commitment to transfer technology and financial resources to developing countries

 <p> MALAYSIA said it is hard to see the need for differentiation between countries

 <p> JAPAN said work on CO2 emissions will be required as the ultimate solution

 The US agreed with the Netherlands that markets can benefit from coordination of standards, but harmonization can be over-emphasized

 <p> KUWAIT said several delegations had referred to the SAR and selective portions and attempted to related them to QELROs

 EGYPT said that QELROs are the real yardstick for measuring the Convention’s success

 MOROCCO said that measures must respect country sovereignty and account for the impact on developing countries

 Pascale Morand Francis (Switzerland) on an informal workshop on QELROs held 28 February 1996

 <p> BRAZIL stated that it may be appropriate to initially establish an overall aggregate quantitative objective and then negotiate the relative participation of countries or the sharing among countries

 TURKEY cited its GDP per capita, anthropogenic emissions per capita and unit of territory and levels of production and consumption of energy per capita

 <p> JAPAN said commitments should be strengthened by combining policies and measures and QELROs, using short-term and medium- or long-term time scales with both legally- binding and target commitments

 ITALY, on behalf of the EU, said based on IPCC projections of atmospheric CO2 stabilization levels and temperature increase, a level of 550 parts per million should guide limitation and reduction efforts

 ROMANIA called for flexibility and cost effective reductions

 She said Romania has used bottom-up approaches that permit reductions without supplementary costs

 <p> NIGERIA said stabilizing emissions at 1990 levels will be costly for the world economy and will not lead to significant abatement compared with business as usual scenarios

 CHINA said reduction objectives and policies and measures are integrated, with policies and measures as means to achieve targets

 <p> GERMANY proposed CO2 reduction objectives of 10% by 2005 and 15-20% by 2010, both against a base year of 1990

 <p> AUSTRALIA said success will be enhanced by recognizing country circumstances

 MALAYSIA said the AOSIS draft protocol should form a basis to elaborate on quantified targets

 AUSTRIA is committed to the Toronto Target as a national target and will increase efforts in the face of evidence it may not reach the target

 <p> CANADA restated its support for the conclusions contained in the SAR

 On timeframes, Canada suggested establishing an objective for the medium- to long-term to avoid preclusion of any options

 <p> IRAN reminded delegates that the Convention contains provisions on sources and sinks and calls for balanced action

 <p> The NETHERLANDS said the IPCC report presents the best available science and, although the information is incomplete, the AGBM must make initial judgments now

 POLAND said that quantification of targets is the most important issue for the AGBM

 SLOVENIA agreed that equity was an important consideration and supported the flat rate approach

 KENYA said that statements by Annex I Parties show their willingness to support new targets

 NORWAY called for differentiated commitments for individual Parties

 <p> THAILAND said the IPCC report stresses the need to immediately reduce emissions

 VENEZUELA said the impact of implementation must be addressed

 Venezuela, like others, is toiling under a burden of foreign debt and needs foreign assistance to carry out social programmes

 NORWAY noted that the removal of subsidies is particularly pertinent to creating market incentives for environmentally sound behavior

 JAPAN said the AGBM must not focus solely on quantified objectives, but also on P&amp;M

 <p> CANADA said climate change is a global problem and requires an effective international response

 <p> AUSTRALIA welcomed indications that Parties have increased their efforts on national communications

 BRAZIL reported on a workshop on a possible format for non-Annex I Parties’ national communications

 <p> The PHILIPPINES said the references to Article 4

<p> INDIA stressed the importance of national communications as part of an ongoing process

<p> CANADA said climate change is a global problem and requires an effective international response

<p> AUSTRALIA welcomed indications that Parties have increased their efforts on national communications

<p> The PHILIPPINES said the references to Article 4

 <p> URUGUAY stated that any agreement reached should be as binding as possible, but noted that some delegates become fearful when the word protocol is mentioned

 CHILE said the AGBM needs to take a political decision and recalled that when the UNFCCC was negotiated, the EU made a binding declaration to establish a stronger sense of commitment

 <p> SENEGAL said that the AGBM cannot continue to “mutter and stammer” when faced with such historic events

 CHINA said there were many precedents for adopting a protocol or amendment, but noted that the need for Annex I countries to strengthen their commitments must not be forgotten

 <p> ARGENTINA emphasized the importance of persevering in the effort to agree on the rules of procedure to revitalize the negotiations

 <p> ESTONIA supported the EU structure as the basis for negotiations

 <p> CANADA said delegates can only decide to seek an amendment or protocol when the nature and scope of commitments are developed

 ITALY, on behalf of the EU, said the EU has already expressed preference for a protocol

 <p> JAPAN said provisions must incorporate measures that lead to technology transfer, AIJ and review mechanisms

 <p> AUSTRALIA said irrespective of form, the legal instrument needs to address all GHGs, sources and sinks in a comprehensive manner, as well as all the BM

 POLAND prefers a protocol, as explained by the EU and Russian Federation

 <p> CHINA said the BM states that the process will produce a legally-binding document

 Results from the Netherlands environmental agency’s IMAGE 2 model presented at a workshop demonstrate the need for 2010 emission limits at 19-46% below 1990 levels, with larger reductions to be safe

<p> URUGUAY stated that any agreement reached should be as binding as possible, but noted that some delegates become fearful when the word protocol is mentioned

<p> CHINA said the BM states that the process will produce a legally-binding document

 Regarding P&amp;M, CHINA proposed adding a reference to QELROs to note that the two concepts are integrated

 The NETHERLANDS disagreed, arguing that not every P&amp;M aspect is linked to QELROs, and asked for flexibility

 SAMOA proposed changing a sentence that stated "Many Parties" agreed that only a legally-binding instrument would meet the requirements of the BM, to "The AGBM agreed" but KUWAIT objected

 INDIA, KUWAIT, CHILE and CHINA objected to a reference to the need for information "in evolving commitments for all Parties

" CANADA and the US called for its retention

 CHINA asked if this was fair and requested its deletion

" VENEZUELA and KUWAIT requested that the record reflect their reservations on the same issue

 Revealed were a new proposal from Germany on specific emissions reductions targets, Japan’s recommendation to incorporate joint implementation officially in future commitments, and even unabashed insistence from Canada and the US that all Parties should eventually take on new commitments

 Germany and the Russian Federation prefer to reserve flexibility for countries with economies in transition, but many others appear to want to apply the idea more widely to the timing, location and, possibly, type of steps a country might take to reduce GHG emissions

 Malaysia also criticized flexibility, but at the same time positively presented ideas on indicators for equitable sharing, another idea Annex I countries were promoting related to differential commitments

 Germany was a rare Annex I critic of differential targets, suggesting that generating indicators would be impractical

 Many countries, including INDIA, JAPAN, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, ZIMBABWE, CANADA, NORWAY, the EU and MALAYSIA, supported the adoption of the Revised 1996 Guidelines for emission inventories

 JAPAN, NORWAY and the EU favored the “actual emission approach,” but also encouraged the submission of data using the “potential approach

 LATVIA supported ROMANIA and POLAND in stressing the need for comparability of methodologies

 JAPAN, INDIA, the EU, NEW ZEALAND and JAPAN stated that the Revised Guidelines should be applied to recalculate 1990 base year GHG inventories and all subsequent years

 A number of countries, including LATVIA, stated that their second inventories are being prepared and that it would be too complicated to recalculate them

 AOSIS, ROMANIA, HUNGARY, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, NORWAY, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, GAMBIA and IRAN supported a more flexible approach, by which the revised methods would be applied as a supplement to the 1995 IPCC Guidelines on a voluntary basis for inventories due in April 1997 and on a mandatory basis for 1998 and 1999

 <p> AUSTRALIA, INDIA, the EU, CANADA and NEW ZEALAND supported the use of the Revised Guidelines by both Annex I and non-Annex I countries

 Some countries, including CHINA, IRAN and POLAND, did not support this position

 MICRONESIA, ROMANIA and the MARSHALL ISLANDS urged flexibility for developing countries to apply the revised guidelines

 MAURITIUS suggested a simplified inventory methodology, given the limited expertise of African countries

 CANADA agreed with JAPAN and HUNGARY that further distribution of the guidelines and methodology was necessary

 <p> Numerous countries, including AUSTRALIA and the US, supported the work programme

 ZIMBABWE urged SBSTA to request the IPCC to conduct awareness programmes through workshops at regional levels

 A number of other countries, including CANADA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, also urged further work on this issue

 MALAYSIA requested the SBSTA to work with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) or the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) on wood products and queried how to take anthropogenic forest fires into account in national reporting

 AUSTRALIA asked for work on anthropogenic emissions in the context of land use change and the forestry sector and noted similarities between harvested wood products, traded emissions and bunker fuels

 The draft conclusions took note of the revised schedule of work and urged the IPCC to give high priority to the development of regional scenarios and regional impacts of climate change and, as added by KUWAIT, to economic impact assessments of new commitments by Annex I countries

 GERMANY added a reference to the early 1997 IPCC discussion paper on the preparation of the TAR

 The EU, supported by TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, ARGENTINA, CANADA, SWITZERLAND, GERMANY and the US, proposed requesting the IPCC to complete this work on the basis of these submissions in consultation with the Joint Working Group of officers of the FCCC and the IPCC

 The Chair moved to adopt the conclusions as amended, but SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT and NIGERIA strongly opposed this proposal and called its adoption “illegal

 CHINA, the PHILIPPINES and KUWAIT opposed the EU’s preference to “approve and adopt” the Revised Guidelines

 <p> Following comments from the EU and the PHILIPPINES on non-Annex I Parties’ use of guidelines and methodologies for inventories, ARGENTINA suggested text encouraging non-Annex I Parties’ to apply the revised 1996 guidelines in communicating their national GHG inventories

 ECUADOR suggested giving priority to methods for projecting emissions and for evaluating AIJ

 AUSTRALIA suggested additions to the Secretariat’s budget

 The MARSHALL ISLANDS concurred with this and, supported by ECUADOR, suggested requesting the governing bodies of international organizations to give a high priority to work in support of the FCCC process

 KUWAIT proposed adding socio-economic analysis to the list of methodological topics proposed

 <p> The MARSHALL ISLANDS, NORWAY, MICRONESIA and INDIA favored deferring consideration of this issue and requesting Parties to submit comments

 The MARSHALL ISLANDS and INDIA said they would allow provision of supplementary information based on the documents

 AUSTRALIA supported the revisions to guidelines but called for work on defining anthropogenic emissions

 DENMARK noted that his country experiences random electricity emissions fluctuations due to climatic factors

 AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND also favored the use of unadjusted figures

 AUSTRALIA noted that electricity trading is part of the general issue of trade in high carbon intensive commodities

 Supported by NORWAY, he noted the need for a methodology for consistent emissions allocation

 <p> On temperature adjustments, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, INDIA and JAPAN favored unadjusted emissions reporting in inventories and a separate method for treating adjustments

 JAPAN called for a unified approach to be discussed by the IPCC

 AUSTRALIA highlighted that temperature adjustments are based on cyclical fluxes like other climatic events and, therefore, should follow the same conceptual approach

 <p> On global warming potentials (GWPs), INDIA expressed concern about inconsistencies in their use and asked for comparability in reports

 JAPAN suggested that Parties using GWPs utilize the GWP guidelines adopted at COP-2, but preferred reporting on GHGs gas-by-gas

 AUSTRALIA noted that P&amp;Ms cover all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of GHGs and, therefore, favored aggregating activities in all sectors for a “net” emissions figure

 However, JAPAN noted methodological problems in this category and NEW ZEALAND said the issue of subtraction depends on resolving other issues

 Both JAPAN and NEW ZEALAND favored the “net approach”, but until these problems are resolved JAPAN stated a preference for use of gross figures

 CANADA highlighted non-environmental benefits and opposed the inclusion of confidential details in the tables

 CHINA, supported by the US, called for language rejecting credits for AIJ emissions reductions during the pilot phase

 JAPAN proposed language on project implementation status and the provision of information from the sub-national level

 <p> AUSTRALIA, MICRONESIA and ARGENTINA differentiated projects under development from those being implemented

 In the discussions on the update, MALAYSIA warned against conversion of bilateral projects into AIJ projects and ZIMBABWE drew attention to two AIJ projects in his country and a future national workshop

 Supported by MAURITIUS, CHINA, IRAN, MALAYSIA, MOROCCO and ARGENTINA, the G- 77/CHINA called for deletion of references to modalities for crediting

 AUSTRALIA proposed criteria for AIJ including crediting, cost-effectiveness of projects and additionality

 <p> The PHILIPPINES, UGANDA, INDIA, SWITZERLAND, MAURITIUS and the EU highlighted AIJ additionality to Annex II countries’ commitments

 <p> SBI Chair Mohamed Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania) stated that he favored an efficient short session, without reopening a formal debate

 <p> The PHILIPPINES noted that the G-77/China draft proposal would avoid inconsistency with the Convention

 ARGENTINA, INDIA, IRAN and KUWAIT supported the G-77/China proposal

 The PHILIPPINES described the proposal’s provisions in detail and highlighted the importance of funding the agreed full costs for national communications and agreed full incremental costs for all commitments under Article 4

 INDIA said the proposal recalled more articles of the Convention than the GEF-adopted annex

” CANADA and ITALY also raised questions on the Convention language used in the proposal

 SWEDEN reminded delegates that decisions on guidance to the GEF clearly state that national communications will be financed

 SWITZERLAND called for a permanent body with approximately 10 members that are appointed by the COP

 CHINA stated there was no need to establish a new body

 CHINA noted that an MCP should be invoked only by Parties, involve discussions between Parties and should not “pass judgment” on implementation efforts

 CANADA said an MCP could involve a representative group of Parties with expert input, if needed

 JAPAN noted that the process should only involve a limited number of Parties, otherwise the SBI should be involved

 CANADA said that Parties should be free to raise their own implementation issues

 The PHILIPPINES cautioned against derogating the balance within the Convention and said an MCP should be a consultative process and nothing else

 CHINA reiterated that it was not urgent to establish an MCP

 <p> Regarding an MCP’s area of expertise, MOROCCO said that legal, economic, social and technical issues should be addressed

 SWITZERLAND said technical and scientific issues could be addressed unless it would duplicate other bodies’ work

 The US and CANADA suggested drawing from a roster of experts for consultation

 CHINA and KUWAIT said it is premature to draw conclusions

 AUSTRIA noted that if an MCP advises Parties on solving problems then questions of individual performance must be part of the procedure

 Many countries, including CANADA, VENEZUELA, AUSTRALIA, IRAN and SLOVENIA, supported an advisory approach

 MOROCCO said an MCP could play both an advisory and a supervisory role

 CHINA said an MCP must provide recommendations and be non- supervisory and non-judgmental

 The NETHERLANDS suggested that an MCP should function as a “help desk” where a Party with a problem can seek advice

 CANADA noted that only Article 14 refers to interpretation and issues might be referred to an MCP via Article 13

 VENEZUELA said that interpretation should be left to the COP

 FRANCE responded that the possible role in interpretation should not be excluded

 AUSTRALIA said an MCP could play a role in interpreting or clarifying obligations through practical assistance rather than judicial-style interpretation

 CHINA stated that many differences of opinion are due to misinformation and an MCP could allow Parties to exchange views on interpretation

 MOROCCO said an MCP should adopt recommendations and report to the COP independently of the SBSTA and the SBI

 KUWAIT noted the importance of identifying the areas of concern for an MCP and said that many of the issues presented here fall under existing bodies

 On the relationship between Articles 13 and 14, JAPAN, VENEZUELA, MOROCCO and SLOVENIA noted that Articles 13 and 14 are clearly different

 CHILE noted that Article 14 requires Parties to settle disputes through negotiation or “any other peaceful means” and an MCP could provide this type of advisory service

 CANADA, ITALY, the EU, ZIMBABWE, SLOVENIA, the PHILIPPINES and CHILE supported a standing committee

 JAPAN preferred an <i>ad hoc </i>group to address issues as identified by the SBI

 The NETHERLANDS cautioned that associating the committee too closely with the SBI would hamper its freedom of movement

 KUWAIT stated that the creation of another institution would be burdensome and noted that any group formed should be linked to the SBI

 CANADA, the EU, ZIMBABWE, ITALY, MOROCCO, the PHILIPPINES and CHILE called for equitable geographic representation

 The PHILIPPINES and CHINA proposed forming an open- ended group, but cautioned that limiting the size could also limit equitable geographical distribution

 JAPAN supported using other criteria and the NETHERLANDS supported further consideration of <i>ex officio</i> representation for SBI and SBSTA

 ZIMBABWE stated that individual Parties should decide whether committee members are delegates, national NGOs or others

 CHINA preferred governmental officials who are experts on Article 13

 ITALY proposed ensuring stability through the election of a president and a vice-president, and appointing members on the principle of rotation, with two-year memberships

 KUWAIT suggested drawing experts from the SBSTA and the IPCC

 KUWAIT, IRAN and INDIA said that issues taken up should be restricted to those submitted by Parties and subsidiary bodies

 IRAN proposed amending “geographical representation” to “equitable” geographical representation

 CANADA, supported by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, proposed deleting a “protocol” as a possible way of establishing an MCP

 <p> CHINA, the PHILIPPINES, IRAN, JAPAN, THAILAND, CHILE, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, GAMBIA, KUWAIT and MOROCCO said it would be premature to make conclusions on areas of convergence because the process is still evolving and contributions have been preliminary

<p> Regarding an MCP’s area of expertise, MOROCCO said that legal, economic, social and technical issues should be addressed

<p> CHINA, the PHILIPPINES, IRAN, JAPAN, THAILAND, CHILE, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, GAMBIA, KUWAIT and MOROCCO said it would be premature to make conclusions on areas of convergence because the process is still evolving and contributions have been preliminary

 A number of countries, including the EU, the G-77/CHINA, MALAYSIA, CANADA, SAUDI ARABIA, NIGERIA and THAILAND, emphasized the importance of specialized information centers and networks

 INDIA also advocated use of existing technology information centers

 AUSTRALIA said that its technology transfer efforts coincide with needs outlined by CHINA: environmentally sound, appropriate for users, driven by recipient countries, and involving hard and soft technology

 CHINA and the PHILIPPINES wanted to add that it is mainly the role of Annex II Parties to carry out such activities

 CANADA and the US did not agree

 MALAYSIA added that the SBSTA shall address this issue at its next session

<p> The G-77/CHINA, supported by KIRIBATI, MALAYSIA, NIGERIA, the MARSHALL ISLANDS, THAILAND, INDIA and TANZANIA, said fulfillment of developing countries’ commitments depends on the provision of resources and technology transfer and is the basis for all negotiations, including AGBM discussions

 CHINA, supported by the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, requested that future progress reports should be prepared, bearing in mind COP-2 Decision 10, which requests the secretariat to report on its activities

 BURKINA FASO and ALGERIA stressed that procedures to deal with the GEF can be very cumbersome and that efforts made by non-Annex I Parties must be recognized

<p> This workshop was convened on Wednesday, 26 February, and chaired by Katsunori Suzuki (Japan)

 CHINA said the disbursement process should be streamlined and more flexible

 COLOMBIA said a review of the financial mechanism this year is premature and more time is needed to examine the results of the GEF’s investment projects

 IRAN stated that one session would not be sufficient for adequate consideration of the review process

 CANADA said that in addition to discrete projects, the review should also address elements, such as the GEF’s ability to cooperate with other international organizations, leverage resources and “mainstream” environmental concerns

 JAPAN also expressed concern regarding the total amount of resources and requested more information on how increases will be accounted for

 <p> Regarding liaison offices, the US, supported by CANADA, proposed performing periodic visits rather than maintaining liaison offices in New York and Geneva

 JAPAN proposed cooperative arrangements for liaison arrangements

 COLOMBIA drew the attention of donor countries to the fund for developing country participation and underscored its importance in light of the move to Bonn

 <p> CHINA said that the SBI should consider informal intersessional consultations to facilitate agreement on the programme budget “if feasible

 CHINA proposed noting that “many delegations stressed that any budget proposal must be in line with the Convention provisions and the relevant COP decisions

 The US also noted that he would make additional proposals if the proposals of the EU and CHINA were accepted

 CHINA suggested, as an alternative, taking “full” account of the views expressed

 CHINA requested an additional sentence referring to the importance of paper document distribution to developing countries, as many of them lack Internet connections

<p> CHINA, supported by the EU, CANADA, JAPAN and the US, welcomed the document and requested more time for its consideration

<p> Regarding liaison offices, the US, supported by CANADA, proposed performing periodic visits rather than maintaining liaison offices in New York and Geneva

<p> CHINA said that the SBI should consider informal intersessional consultations to facilitate agreement on the programme budget “if feasible

 In December 1996, the Government of Germany issued an ordinance on the provisional application of the Agreement

 He noted that a draft has been prepared (FCCC/SBI/1997/4) and an informal group chaired by Takao Shibata (Japan) will address the issue

 KUWAIT noted that COP- 2 took note of, “but did not adopt” the Geneva Ministerial Declaration and that a later reference to the Geneva Ministerial Declaration should be coupled with a reference to another statement adopted by those delegations that did not support the Declaration

 CHINA said that the reference to avoiding greenhouse gas emissions was unacceptable because they occur naturally

 <p> The G-77/CHINA, supported by CHINA and BOTSWANA, expressed concern about the late distribution of documents for the current session

 <p> CHINA, supported by the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, INDIA, BURKINA FASO, MALAYSIA and the G-77/CHINA, proposed stating that any new substantive proposals must be communicated in draft form to all Parties six months before the ministerial segment

 CHINA amended his proposal to request communication from “six months” to “well in advance” of COP-3

” MALAYSIA stated that he was caught in surprise at COP-2 and felt an “air of conspiracy

” ARGENTINA reminded delegates that the SBI can provide recommendations to the COP but cannot decide what the COP will do

 The US, supported by GERMANY and the UK, proposed that the SBI should keep the arrangements of the conference under review and recommends that any new, substantive proposals concerning these arrangements be communicated well in advance of the start of the conference

 CHINA said this did not solve the problem of transparency and noted that “arrangements” and “proposals” are not the same thing

 MALAYSIA proposed noting that all action be “in accordance with normal UN practice

<p> The G-77/CHINA, supported by CHINA and BOTSWANA, expressed concern about the late distribution of documents for the current session

 UZBEKISTAN envisaged the MCP as a process that renders consultative services to Parties and called for a special group with wide geographic representation to address issues of law, economics, ecology and social issues

 The EU, supported by SWITZERLAND, called for an advisory regime to assist implementation, which would have a broad competence but not encroach on other bodies

 CHINA noted that an MCP should take action prior to, rather than following, implementation

 The US, supported by JAPAN, said that including scientific and technological expertise could lead to duplication of the SBSTA’s work

 JAPAN said that there is broad agreement on an advisory role

 CHILE noted that Article 14 calls for settlement of disputes through negotiations or “any other peaceful means,” and that an MCP could fill the latter role

 CHINA called for further definitions

 <p> Several countries, including the EU, CHILE and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, said the MCP’s objective should be to find solutions to problems of implementation, to provide assistance to Parties and to prevent disputes from arising

 CHINA, supported by ITALY, the EU and FINLAND, said that promoting “implementation” was more appropriate than promoting “compliance" since an MCP’s function should be advisory

 On expertise, the EU, supported by CHILE, noted an MCP should address any questions that could arise in any discipline and members should have sufficient expertise to ask the right questions to experts outside the group

 CHILE, CHINA, the EU, SWITZERLAND and SLOVENIA supported a standing body with a stable and fixed basis

 To avoid greater bureaucracy, CHILE suggested establishing a small body where members would be selected for a specified time and that could meet concurrently with other subsidiary bodies

 IRAN spoke against creating a new institution, stressed its budgetary implications and noted the problem that additional meetings pose for developing countries

 The EU and SWITZERLAND suggested a standing committee, which would report to the COP

 <p> CHINA, supported by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and IRAN, stated that substance and functions of an MCP should be discussed before its form, and suggested that an MCP could be an <i>ad hoc </i>committee

 SWITZERLAND and the EU cautioned that the COP should not be obliged to take a decision on every MCP item

 CHINA preferred that the COP govern the process but that reports and recommendations are sent to the COP via the SBI

 CHINA cautioned that Article 13 states an MCP would only be available to Parties, “on their own request”

 The EU and CHINA said the COP should establish an MCP process

 <p> In discussing this proposal, the EU, supported by SLOVENIA, proposed that an MCP could be a “standing” group

 CHINA, the EU, ZIMBABWE, FRANCE and SWITZERLAND said the main objective should be to provide assistance to individual Parties rather than to the COP

” The EU and EGYPT insisted on bracketing the US proposal

 <p> On an MCP’s functions, FRANCE wished to reserve the opportunity for the COP to entrust tasks to an MCP and said a five-member MCP could be feasible considering the likelihood of additional <i>ex officio</i> members

 In response to concerns expressed by MALAYSIA and IRAN, the Chair suggested that MCP meetings occur in conjunction with COP and subsidiary body meetings

 CHINA suggested a new paragraph stating that an MCP’s function should be “to provide assistance to Parties in relation to difficulties they encounter in the course of implementation including: (1) clarification of questions and (2) assistance to the developing countries Parties in accordance with Article 12

 <p> The US and ITALY expressed their concern about adding the Chinese proposal

<p> CHINA warned against duplication of existing mechanisms and said that the FCCC should not copy the non-compliance procedure under the Montreal Protocol

<p> Several countries, including the EU, CHILE and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, said the MCP’s objective should be to find solutions to problems of implementation, to provide assistance to Parties and to prevent disputes from arising

 <p> CHINA, IRAN and MOROCCO, on behalf of the African Group, requested clarification on the division of tasks between non-groups and asked whether the non-groups would address P&amp;Ms and QELROs

 The G-77/CHINA, supported by the EU, MALAYSIA and the AFRICAN GROUP urged for a limited number of additional groups, given the constraints facing small delegations

 CHINA also cautioned AGBM not to “waste time” on issues related to institutions and definitions

 IRAN said the EU proposal was premature and SAUDI ARABIA urged that AGBM complete a negotiating text and not leave work for the Chair

 The proposal by POLAND, BULGARIA, ESTONIA, LATVIA and SLOVENIA, stated that QELROs should be legally binding

 <p> FRANCE proposed differentiating the commitments of Annex I Parties according to present emission levels of greenhouse gases per inhabitant and per GDP

 <p> ICELAND proposed differentiation and the following parameters for identifying differences in national circumstances: GHG emission intensity and level, share of renewable energy sources and GDP per capita

 He supported the formula Norway presented at AGBM-5, amended to account for the share of renewable energy

 MALAYSIA commented that parameters are changing regularly

 MAURITIUS inquired about a supervisory mechanism for this formula

 VENEZUELA, supported by COSTA RICA, suggested “historical responsibility” as an additional criterion for differentiation

 SWITZERLAND added “past efforts” by countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as another criterion

 IRAN also proposes a compensation mechanism for adverse impacts of response measures

 Responding to ZIMBABWE, IRAN noted that its proposed compensation mechanism is designed to compensate countries that incur losses due to polices and measures stipulated by the AGBM legal instrument and does not provide funds for countries that incur damages resulting directly from climate change

 IRAN replied that further details would be supplied at a later date

 <p> AUSTRALIA proposed: a collective reduction objective for “Annex A” Parties, which are those listed in Annex I of the FCCC; mitigation activities that result in equal percentage changes in per capita economic welfare among “Annex A” Parties; differentiated commitments; use of indicators in the negotiation process; and further consideration of market-based approaches such as emissions trading and joint implementation

 Responding to MALAYSIA, AUSTRALIA said formula approaches are too simplistic to account for wide variations among countries’ circumstances and emphasized that differentiation is not a means to delay action, but to achieve fairness

 CHINA expressed concern that emissions trading would replace government commitments with activities of firms and individuals

 <p> KUWAIT, NIGERIA and SAUDI ARABIA supported the proposal by the G-77/China

 ITALY pointed out that the Convention does not include a compensation mechanism

 SAUDI ARABIA, supported by IRAN, noted Article 4

 KUWAIT noted his disappointment that the developed countries' proposals do not mention any provision for developing countries' compensation

 <p> CANADA noted that economic change in energy sources has occurred over the past century and will continue regardless of a protocol

 THAILAND suggested that AGBM not spend time discussing emissions trading

 <p> UZBEKISTAN proposed differentiation for Annex I Parties, according to the level of economic development and GDP per capita

<p> FRANCE proposed differentiating the commitments of Annex I Parties according to present emission levels of greenhouse gases per inhabitant and per GDP

<p> ICELAND proposed differentiation and the following parameters for identifying differences in national circumstances: GHG emission intensity and level, share of renewable energy sources and GDP per capita

<p> AUSTRALIA proposed: a collective reduction objective for “Annex A” Parties, which are those listed in Annex I of the FCCC; mitigation activities that result in equal percentage changes in per capita economic welfare among “Annex A” Parties; differentiated commitments; use of indicators in the negotiation process; and further consideration of market-based approaches such as emissions trading and joint implementation

<p> AGBM Chair Raï¿½l Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) opened the second meeting of AGBM-6 by stating that this meeting is not intended for negotiating but for refining and consolidating similar proposals contained in the Framework Compilation of Proposals (FCCC/AGBM/1997/2 and Add

 <p> SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA said the comments from Parties contained in document FCCC/AGBM/1997/2/Add

 CHINA also expressed confusion regarding references to Annexes X, A and B in the proposals and urged Parties to refrain from developing new categories

 JAPAN suggested that Annex I Parties adopt P&amp;Ms according to national circumstances, in the areas of efficient use of energy, low-carbon energy, technological development and cooperation, and enhancement of sinks

 <p> The EU, supported by SWITZERLAND, favored legally binding P&amp;Ms and highlighted his proposed Annexes A (common P&amp;Ms), B (coordinated P&amp;Ms that receive high priority) and C (priority P&amp;Ms for inclusion in national programmes)

 POLAND and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION supported a menu approach, which takes account of various economic structures and attempts to maintain a high and stable rate of economic growth

 IRAN stressed the need for a section on general commitments and guiding measures in the protocol

 He also noted that paragraphs proposed by a number of Parties including Norway, Iceland, New Zealand and Switzerland could be integrated into the EU proposal

 <p> CHINA reiterated that the Berlin Mandate requires an elaboration of P&amp;Ms whose objectives should be clear at this stage

 The Chair, supported by IRAN, said these concerns are better addressed when considering QELROs

<p> SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA said the comments from Parties contained in document FCCC/AGBM/1997/2/Add

<p> The EU, supported by SWITZERLAND, favored legally binding P&amp;Ms and highlighted his proposed Annexes A (common P&amp;Ms), B (coordinated P&amp;Ms that receive high priority) and C (priority P&amp;Ms for inclusion in national programmes)

<p> CHINA reiterated that the Berlin Mandate requires an elaboration of P&amp;Ms whose objectives should be clear at this stage

<p> Chair Chow Kok Kee (Malaysia) welcomed the speakers on differentiation and called for a non-confrontational process that promotes understanding rather than political positions

 Harald Dovland (Norway) said that differentiation provides for a more equitable and ambitious goal than the lowest common denominator agreement allowed by a flat-rate approach

 Akihiko Furuya (Japan) said that differentiation is indispensable for achieving fairness and noted that the Berlin Mandate calls for taking into account the different starting points of countries

 Maciej Sadowski (Poland) said that the preferred approach involves differentiation by countries and noted that aggregation into groups could be effective

 Louet (France) noted that differentiation is not a result of theoretical considerations, but of unavoidable practical necessity

 He noted that the EU has adopted a common position and explained that a greenhouse gas emission reduction of 30% for Luxembourg and 25% for Germany, could be offset by Portugal’s and Greece’s respective greenhouse gas emission increase of 30% and 40%, which account for differences in starting points

 SWITZERLAND stressed that there is no good unique indicator that can take into account national circumstances and said that the logical starting point of the discussion is agreement on the quantity to differentiate

 GERMANY urged countries to enrich progress by making concrete proposals regarding numbers for significant overall reductions and the contributions that countries intend to make toward these goals

 Howard Bamsey (Australia) stressed that differentiation is necessary for reflecting different national circumstances

 <p> GERMANY stated that differentiation within the EU was not based on indicators, because indicators do not reflect political reality

 She noted that Germany, Denmark and Austria accepted the largest shares of the reduction burden because they are convinced that combating climate change is important

 <p> GERMANY, referring to the EU experience, suggested making a joint commitment for a future protocol, setting common targets for Annex I Parties and deciding how to share them

 AUSTRALIA asked how differentiation was achieved within the EU and noted this could set an example for Annex I countries on the road to Kyoto

 ICELAND stressed the need to reach conclusions on differentiation before Kyoto

<p> GERMANY stated that differentiation within the EU was not based on indicators, because indicators do not reflect political reality

<p> GERMANY, referring to the EU experience, suggested making a joint commitment for a future protocol, setting common targets for Annex I Parties and deciding how to share them

 <p> The INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES, on behalf of local governments, announced that the World Summit for Cities for Climate Protection will meet in Nagoya, Japan to raise awareness at the local level of the importance of combating climate change

 He noted that proposals by Germany, France and the UK on legally binding reduction objectives are already contained in the other proposals and can be deleted

 SWITZERLAND stressed that each Annex I Party should adopt legally binding QELROs

 NIGERIA requested the deletion of a reference to the Geneva Ministerial Declaration, which calls for legally-binding QELROs for Annex I Parties within specified time-frames with respect to sources and removal of sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol

 PERU referred to the Geneva Declaration and called for reduction target for the year 2005

 HUNGARY supported the US’s long-term goal for atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations

 <p> NORWAY and ICELAND withdrew their proposals, as they were contained in other proposals

 CHINA said that the text should only include issues on which agreement has been reached

 JAPAN did not agree and called for retention of its proposal that QELROs would be set for C02 only

 CHINA called for all other Annex I countries to propose QELROs with time frames as the EU has done

 He opposed emissions borrowing and, with HUNGARY, opposed a new category for countries that are rapidly developing

 <p> Chair Chow Kok Kee (MALAYSIA) reported on the roundtable on differentiation

 NORWAY noted that ambitious targets via legally binding commitments can only be achieved through efforts such as differentiation, equitable burden sharing, comprehensive treatment of sources and sinks, and coordination of economic instruments

 AUSTRALIA insisted that its complete text on differentiation be reproduced in the document

 <p> On the issue of “flexibility ,” MALAYSIA,<i> </i>supported by CHINA, requested deletion of the entire section on flexibility

 UZBEKISTAN called for the retention of text noting that JI can serve as an instrument to allow technology transfer on a more beneficial basis

 SWITZERLAND supported retaining its proposal that: JI may contribute up to 50% to meeting a country’s fulfillment of commitments; JI may begin in 2000; JI can also take place with non-Parties to the Protocol

 PERU requested retaining JI in the text, until the review at the end of the year

 SAUDI ARABIA and NIGERIA requested retaining paragraphs relating to loss of income

<p> The INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES, on behalf of local governments, announced that the World Summit for Cities for Climate Protection will meet in Nagoya, Japan to raise awareness at the local level of the importance of combating climate change

<p> Chair Chow Kok Kee (MALAYSIA) reported on the roundtable on differentiation

<p> On the issue of “flexibility ,” MALAYSIA,<i> </i>supported by CHINA, requested deletion of the entire section on flexibility

 The Chair’s proposal is followed by entries from several countries including Canada, the EU, Switzerland and Japan

 IRAN inquired about the possibility of elaborating on each proposal

 <p> POLAND requested that each reference to a new Annex specify which Parties will be included

<p> POLAND requested that each reference to a new Annex specify which Parties will be included

 MOROCCO, on behalf of the African group, reported the following nominees: Mr

 australia proposed language noting that ungass should recommend that the fccc accelerate negotiations, produce a satisfactory result and recognize the global nature of the problem

 the eu, supported by switzerland, proposed specific emissions reduction targets (15% reduction below 1990 levels by 2010)

 japan called for agreement on quantified objectives for emission reductions and agreement to elaborate on policies and measures

 the us, australia, japan, canada, colombia, iran, russia, venezuela, nigeria and saudi arabia objected to including specific negotiating positions in the text and cautioned against prejudging the cop-3 outcome

 a ministerial group on climate change met on thursday, 26 june chaired by ministers from argentina and japan

 brazil and switzerland noted that the public would measure the success of ungass by its statement on climate change

 japan proposed using language from the denver g-8 summit, which stated that at cop-3 the industrialized countries should commit to meaningful, realistic and equitable targets that will result in reductions of greenhouse gas emissions by 2010

 japan objected to "significant" and australia disapproved of "legally-binding

 norway, brazil, aosis, switzerland, trinidad and tobago and the eu expressed strong regret that ungass could not agree on recommendations and requested an additional session

 among the key conclusions are: ecosystems, \r\nespecially forests and coral reefs, are highly sensitive to \r\nclimate change; billions of people could be impacted by \r\nexacerbated problems in drinking water supply, sanitation, \r\nand drought; food production could decrease in the tropics \r\nand subtropics, despite steady global production; \r\nsignificantly adverse effects on small island states and \r\nlow-lying deltas such as in bangladesh, egypt and china \r\ncould displace tens of millions of people with one meter of \r\nsea-level rise; heat stress mortality and vector-borne \r\ndiseases could increase; and that most effects are negative \r\nfor the most vulnerable developing countries

\r\n<p>\r\namong regional findings, he noted: that africa is most \r\nvulnerable because poverty limits the capacity for \r\nadaptation; that arid western asia and australia could face \r\nexacerbated water scarcity; that vulnerable systems face \r\nmultiple stresses in latin america; that changes could \r\nchallenge adaptation even in natural forests and water \r\nresources in parts of north america; and that sea level \r\nrise threatens cultures if not elimination of small island \r\nstates

\r\n<p>\r\ncanada, malaysia and the marshall islands said the cop \r\nshould address the decline of global observation networks, \r\nwhile saudi arabia had reservations

 china said because predictions for 100 year \r\nscenarios are unreliable, it is impossible for developing \r\ncountries to adopt actions for the next 100 years

 on additional policy relevant questions to be \r\naddressed, parties made the following suggestions: a \r\nreference to additional gases that are believed to have a \r\nradiative forcing impact, and the importance of monitoring \r\nthe adequacy of the systematic observation system (us); the \r\nuse of non-english language references in support of ipcc \r\nreports (mongolia); and explanations of the range of \r\nuncertainty in ipcc findings (malaysia)

 the netherlands said the \r\nessence of the draft conclusions is a request to the \r\nsecretariat to continue using the roster for methodological \r\nand technical guidance and an invitation to prepare an \r\nevaluation before cop-5

 in the absence of initial formal proposals for\r\n emissions reduction targets by the us and japan, there was a widespread sense that most of\r\n the progress achieved at this session was limited to a reduction in the number of\r\n proposals

 she called a 15% target by 2010 a minimum\r\n and demanded leadership from annex i parties, especially japan and the us

 canada supported linking entry into force to both ratifications and emissions,\r\n but he said the emissions threshold should be 5 gigatonnes rather than 3 as in the text

 japan, the eu and the us preferred to remove brackets from the mitigation\r\n list, noting that it is indicative

 malaysia questioned the scientific basis for using gwps and\r\n said they do not provide clear ghg inventories

\r\n tanzania presented a draft decision that calls on sbsta to identify gaps developing\r\n countries face in research and development of methodologies, monitoring and assessment\r\n capacity, and observational networks

 china said the\r\n paragraph should be deleted

 malaysia and the\r\n eu said a decision on this should await the outcome of the protocol negotiations

 zimbabwe called for a good spread of\r\n aij projects by sector, country and region and supported the view that current information\r\n could not provide the basis for decisions at cop-3

 india noted the absence of precise\r\n information on the amount of ghg reductions and costs and agreed that current data were\r\n insufficient to reach a judgment on the pilot phase

\r\n uzbekistan called for the inclusion of a methodological item on determining socio-economic\r\n benefits and noted that there were few aij projects in his region

 mauritius said aij must be given the\r\n chance to expand to more countries and sectors

 bhutan said despite its very low capacity, it hopes delegates keep\r\n an open mind regarding methodological issues

 nepal said aij could be a small but indispensable tool for countries\' national\r\n programmes and technical training

<p><font face="times new roman">on 24 october, the co-chair of the aij contact group\r\n reported that the group had worked from proposals by the us, norway and switzerland, which\r\n the co-chair tried to incorporate

<p><font face="times new roman">japan and zimbabwe agreed that although a useful tool, the\r\n roster lacked geographical balance, perhaps due to inadequate dissemination of information\r\n on the roster in certain regions

 malaysia and india noted an emerging consensus that some\r\n of the issues need to be studied by groups of experts

<p><font face="times new roman">on 28 october, the chair invited comments on draft\r\n conclusions in a paper drawn up by zimbabwe, malaysia, india, the us, canada, and the\r\n netherlands on the roster of experts

 the netherlands explained that the essence of the\r\n draft conclusions is a request to the secretariat to continue using the roster for\r\n methodological and technical guidance and an invitation to prepare an evaluation before\r\n cop-5

 the philippines introduced an amendment on\r\n criteria for using members of the roster, ensuring that the element of capacity building\r\n is fully respected

 malaysia pointed out that sbsta could request, not authorize, that the\r\n secretariat continue using the roster

 malaysia said the secretariat should promote decision-making\r\n tools and develop a technology information center

 tied to the second question is the "frantic\r\n activity" planned during the intersessional period as japan throws itself into the\r\n host\'s role as honest broker of a deal with which all the key players can live

 some calculations suggest a reduction within the range proposed by japan would not\r\n add significantly to the current us burden

 in bonn, leading "differentiators," including australia, norway, and\r\n japan, largely refused to move on other issues until the prospects for a differentiated\r\n approach to qelros become clear

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The Third Conference of the Parties (COP-3) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) will open on 1 December 1997 at the Kyoto International Conference Hall in Kyoto, Japan

 HUNGARY supported using a three-gas basket, and addressing the three additional gases later

 EGYPT reserved the right to consult within the G-77/China, which will provide a joint statement

 TANZANIA highlighted the G-77/China proposal, which would call upon Parties to reduce emissions of three gases and make efforts to control and phase out the other three

 NORWAY noted its support for the proposal by the Chair and said that methodologies were available to work on the basis of six GHGs

 CHINA reiterated the G-77/China’s preference for a gas-by-gas approach

 SWITZERLAND said that it originally made a proposal based on three GHGs, but favored the inclusion of all GHGs not covered by the Montreal Protocol, including HFCs, PFCs, and SF</font><font face="Tahoma" size="1"><sub>6</sub></font><font face="Tahoma" size="2">

 POLAND suggested that additional GHGs could be included at a later stage

 BRAZIL noted that long-lived gases required the attention of the AGBM and hoped that consensus could be reached in this respect

 BRAZIL and ICELAND indicated that the issue of sinks needed to be sorted out before settling targets for QELROs

 BRAZIL noted the value of the third option as a basis for compromise

 CHINA said the budget concept has been introduced along with a string of extraneous issues

 EGYPT invited the Chair to present a balanced proposal

 He said the question of policies and measures is linked to other issues including the basket of gases to be adopted and the level of flexibility to be accorded to Russia and other countries with economies in transition

 The G-77/ CHINA objected to the inclusion of a reference to non-Annex I Parties

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The Third Conference of the Parties (COP-3) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) opened on 1 December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Chen Chimutengwende (Zimbabwe), President of the Second Conference of the Parties (COP-2), stated that delegates face a political dilemma of apportioning responsibility for the historical burden that humanity has placed on itself

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">Raúl Estrada Oyuela (Argentina) reported to COP-3 on the work of the AGBM

 The Chair drew attention to a number of issues that were not fully addressed in the AGBM, such as: methodologies to estimate emissions by sources and removals by sinks; the treatment of sinks under the new instrument; a proposal made by Brazil; and the issue of future development of commitments for all Parties, referred to by some as “evolution

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The G-77/CHINA, supported by INDIA, BRAZIL, CHINA, MALAYSIA, SAUDI ARABIA, EGYPT, INDONESIA and AOSIS, objected to discussing evolution of commitments

 INDIA cited the decision of COP-1 that the Berlin Mandate be confined to reviewing the commitments of Annex I countries on strengthening developed countries’ commitments to GHG reductions and operationalization of resources transfer

 BRAZIL noted that its proposal is useful, while the evolution clause is an extraneous distraction from the main purpose of reducing the emissions of the main Annex I polluters

 CHINA said the evolution proposal is: outside the scope of the Berlin Mandate process, which prevails until its outcome is adopted at COP-3; a political move to let some countries evade their responsibilities; intended to destroy the FCCC’s principle of common but differentiated responsibilities; and intended to lead to the failure of COP- 3

 CHINA noted that efforts to advance existing commitments are handicapped by a lack of resources and called for a substantial increase in the GEF replenishment

 SWITZERLAND, supported by the US, said that GEF should be established as the permanent FCCC financial mechanism

 The PHILIPPINES mentioned experiencing problems with implementing agencies and said that they should be more aware of decisions taken by the GEF Council

 INDIA, BHUTAN, BANGLADESH and KIRIBATI highlighted the importance of obtaining GEF financing for national communications

 CHINA, supported by INDIA and IRAN, observed two tendencies: developed countries are only interested in transfer of technical information, while developing countries deem technology transfer on non-commercial and preferential terms most important; and some countries emphasize market mechanisms

 JAPAN outlined the Kyoto Initiative to strengthen assistance for developing countries in their efforts to combat global warming, to be operated through the national Official Development Assistance program

 INDIA, supported by IRAN, called for the operationalization of the FCCC provisions relating to state-of-the-art environmentally sound technologies (EST), with supporting provisions in the new legal instrument

 ZIMBABWE outlined her country’s difficulties with basic economic development and the financial impact of El Niño

 IRAN identified obstacles facing developing countries seeking transfers of technology at their own expense due to restrictions imposed by developed countries

 AOSIS, with CHINA and ZIMBABWE, stated that deliberation of this item is premature given that it is unclear what the actions taken under the Berlin Mandate process will accomplish

 CHINA disagreed, saying that the review is independent of the outcome in Kyoto and noting the Article 4

 CANADA expressed uncertainty as to what the review would accomplish

2(f), delegates agreed on the proposal that Croatia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia replace Czechoslovakia in Annex I

 Delegates debated at length a proposal by Azerbaijan and Pakistan to delete Turkey from Annex I and Annex II

 IRAN, TURKEY and KUWAIT supported the proposal

 The EU and AUSTRALIA maintained that Turkey should indicate willingness to undertake Protocol obligations under Article 10 before its deletion from the Annexes

 TURKEY noted that questions remain unanswered on the Protocol’s proposed Article 10 and requested that ministers discuss the matter on 10 December

 The Chair proposed that Luis Herrera (Venezuela) undertake consultations on these amendments

 VENEZUELA said the amendment and its provisional application must be considered separately

 Sergio Alejandro Zelaya Bonilla (Honduras) will conduct informal consultations

 Kuwait said the developing countries can only lower emissions through technology, but resources made available to date have been inadequate

 The EU, supported by the US and JAPAN, said donors should not place their resources in the hands of the COP

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The Chair of the negotiating group on sinks, Antonio La Viña (Philippines) said that full agreement had not been possible and introduced a draft document containing three bracketed paragraphs

 AUSTRALIA proposed a new option for a fully comprehensive approach

 JAPAN said his basic approach continues to be the gross approach

 CANADA said Option C does not cover conservation of currently managed forests or agrarian practices and provides no incentive for biodiversity

 BARBADOS supported Option C

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The MARSHALL ISLANDS, supported by GRENADA, cautioned against the uncertainties connected with measuring other activities and preferred putting them in Paragraph 3

 CANADA and NORWAY noted their preference for Option A, saying the uncertainties are overdrawn

 BRAZIL, supported by COSTA RICA, favored Option C as in the original Chair’s text, or dropping the whole Article

 ICELAND, URUGUAY, CANADA, MEXICO, COSTA RICA and NEW ZEALAND supported the US’s concern that Option C refers to only a limited number of activities that can contribute to sinks

 URUGUAY proposed adding “forest management, reforestation and any other forestry activity

” MEXICO suggested “forest management and forest conservation” and COSTA RICA proposed “natural forest regeneration,” and cautioned against allowing sink activities to disappear during the review discussed in Paragraph 3

 ICELAND called for giving Parties credit for the changes occurring during a target year or budget period

 NORWAY, supported by NEW ZEALAND, added brackets around “since 1990” in Option C, as in Options A and B

 GRENADA queried how to measure 1990 sinks now if not already done and suggested giving a negative credit to countries when sinks are destroyed

 ARGENTINA supported Option C, noting its relationship to forest conservation, the Convention to Combat Desertification and recovery of soils

 VENEZUELA said the US amendments would reduce its reluctance regarding Option C

 URUGUAY said the US amendments sought sustainable development

 CANADA supported the modified Option C, as did HONDURAS, who supported Iceland on including soil productivity

 BRAZIL and SAMOA expressed strong disagreement, SAMOA preferring to bracket "deforestation or harvesting

" JAPAN supported the original Option C, but not with the US amendments, which tremendously increased ambiguities and uncertainties

 BARBADOS did not support Option C

 PERU supported Option C but expressed doubts regarding methodology for forest management

 GRENADA did not understand how conservation of forests improves the uptake of a sink

 BRAZIL said the question is: what are man-made activities for which credits should be given to increase emissions? He compared the 6 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon emitted from fossil fuel and 1 Gt from land use change to natural uptake of 2 Gt by oceans and 2 Gt on continental surfaces

<p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The negotiating group on policies and measures discussed a revised draft text prepared by Chair Mohamed Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania)

 One important example is the bilateral contact between the US and Brazil to discuss the fate of the proposed clean development fund

 Bakary Kante (Senegal) reported no consensus on Kuwait’s proposal for a compensation fund

 BRAZIL noted the proposal's political element: that future objectives be established in terms of global mean surface temperature change, as a mechanism for apportioning the burden

 Supported by HUNGARY, the US, CANADA, the EU, POLAND, SLOVENIA, AUSTRALIA, SWITZERLAND, and JAPAN, he introduced a draft text that, inter alia: notes Annex I Party commitments through 2014; considers that future Annex I commitments beyond that date should comprise the widest possible participation in binding action; recognizes the dependence of inception of non-Annex I Parties’ legally binding emissions limitations commitments on Annex I Parties' implementation, particularly of Kyoto Protocol QELROs; agrees there should be further QELROs for Annex I Parties and “quantified emission limitation objectives” for other Parties, except least developed countries; and establishes a process to set the commitments, to be concluded by 2002

 CHINA rejected any attempt to rewrite FCCC Article 4

 The PHILIPPINES, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA and PERU requested more time for the G-77/China to consult on the text because of the links between this paragraph and other outstanding issues, particularly those referring to the advancement of commitments under Article 4

 <p> CANADA introduced text containing seven paragraphs

 <p> INDIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA and supported by CHINA and INDONESIA, reiterated its objection to the concept of emissions trading, stating that it is extraneous to the Berlin Mandate and would not lead to GHG emissions limitation and reduction

 The MARSHALL ISLANDS, COSTA RICA and URUGUAY said they were ready to adopt the existing draft text

 CANADA said there is an inconsistency in the proposals treatment of harvesting, which would cause Canada enormous pain, and reforestation, which would not offset the penalty from harvesting

 MEXICO asked the Chair to include conservation activities in the consideration of a definition of sinks

 <p> Antonio La Viña (Philippines) introduced a revised non- paper on sinks, containing only text relating to Option C of previous non-papers (accounting for limited sink activities to offset emissions)

<p>The Third Conference of the Parties (COP-3) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) was held from 1 - 11 December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan

<p>At AGBM-3, held in Geneva from 5-8 March 1996, delegates heard a number of specific proposals on new commitments for Annex I Parties, including a two-phase CO2 emissions reduction target proposed by Germany

 In the absence of initial formal proposals for emissions reduction targets by the US and Japan, there was a widespread sense that most of the progress achieved at this session was limited to a reduction in the number of proposals

<p>After a one-day resumed session of the AGBM on 30 November 1997, COP-3 officially opened on 1 December at the Kyoto International Conference Hall in Kyoto, Japan

<p>AGBM Chair Raúl Estrada Oyuela (Argentina) noted that there were many unresolved issues regarding QELROs and delegates must decide at some point the number of gases to be included in the protocol

 HUNGARY, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, POLAND and the G-77/CHINA supported using a three-gas basket, addressing the three additional gases later

 NORWAY said that methodologies were available to work on the basis of six GHGs and, with SWITZERLAND, supported the Chair's proposal

 BRAZIL noted that long-lived gases required the attention of the AGBM and hoped that consensus could be reached

<p>The Chair of the informal group on sinks, Antonio La Viña, (Philippines) reported that the group had worked on a proposal containing the following four options: </p> 

 CHINA said the budget concept had been introduced along with a string of extraneous issues

<p>On 1 December, COP-2 President Chen Chimutengwende (Zimbabwe) opened COP-3 and stated that delegates faced a political dilemma of apportioning responsibility for the historical burden that humanity has placed on itself

<p>Hiroshi Ohki (Japan) was then elected President of COP-3

<p>Delegates were also welcomed by: Keizo Obuchi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan; Teiichi Aramaki, Governor of the Prefecture of Kyoto; and Yorikane Masumoto, Mayor of Kyoto

<p>VENEZUELA, SAUDI ARABIA and KUWAIT objected to adopting incomplete rules

 Tibor Faragó (Hungary) introduced the report and draft decisions of the Subsidiary Body on Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/14)

<p>Mohamed Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania) introduced the SBI report (FCCC/SBI/1997/21), which was noted by the COP

 The Chair drew attention to a number of issues that were not fully addressed in the AGBM, such as: methodologies to estimate emissions by sources and removals by sinks; the treatment of sinks under the new instrument; a proposal made by Brazil; and the issue of future development of commitments for all Parties, referred to by some as "evolution

 The PHILIPPINES mentioned problems experienced with implementing agencies and said that they should be more aware of decisions taken by the GEF Council

 JAPAN outlined the Kyoto Initiative to strengthen assistance for developing countries in their efforts to combat global warming, to be operated through the national Official Development Assistance programme

 INDIA, supported by IRAN, called for the operationalization of FCCC provisions relating to state-of-the-art environmentally sound technologies (EST), in the new legal instrument

 ZIMBABWE outlined her country's difficulties with basic economic development and the financial impact of El Niño

<p>On 3 December, AOSIS, CHINA and ZIMBABWE stated that deliberation of this item was premature given that it was unclear what the actions taken under the Berlin Mandate process would accomplish

 CHINA disagreed, saying that the review is independent of the outcome in Kyoto, and noted the Article 4

 They agreed to the proposal that the Czech Republic and Slovakia replace Czechoslovakia in Annex I and that Croatia be added

 TURKEY noted that questions remain unanswered on the Protocol's proposed Article 10 and requested that ministers discuss the matter on 10 December

 The Chair proposed that Luis Herrera (Venezuela) conduct consultations on these amendments

 KUWAIT said the developing countries can only lower emissions through technology, but resources made available to date have been inadequate

" Sergio Selaya Bonilla (Honduras) conducted consultations on the EU's proposal and Bakary Kante (Senegal) on Kuwait's proposal throughout the week

 The Kuwait proposal was not accepted

<p>Following a proposal by CROATIA, delegates discussed the status of Yugoslavia in relation to the Convention

<p>On 5 December, delegates accepted an offer by ARGENTINA to host COP-4 and subsidiary body meetings, from 2-13 November 1998, in Buenos Aires

<p>Ryutaro Hashimoto, Prime Minister of Japan, urged developed countries to agree on meaningful, realistic and equitable emissions reduction targets that are legally binding

<p>Kinza Clodumar, President of Nauru, called the willful destruction of small island States with foreknowledge an "unspeakable crime against humanity

<p>COP President Hiroshi Ohki (Japan) reported substantial progress at the intensive discussions in Kyoto and expressed confidence about a breakthrough for final agreement

<p>On behalf of the G-77 and China, Bakari Mbonde (Tanzania) said decisive action would be needed to strengthen developed country obligations

 Johny Lahure (Luxembourg), on behalf of the EU, rejected differentiation that makes targets weaker

<p>ARTICLE 2 (Policies and Measures): The negotiating group on Article 2 discussed a revised draft text prepared by Chair Mohamed Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania)

<p>In the final Plenary of the COW, KUWAIT proposed deleting subparagraphs on reduction and phasing out of market imperfections and subsidies and on controlling transport sector emissions

<p>Discussions of sinks were held in a contact group chaired by Antonio La Viña (Philippines) during the first week

 Luis Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil) led informal negotiations on language to describe commitment periods, originally termed "budget periods

 Canada submitted a proposal on QELROs consisting of a 3% reduction of GHGs below 1990 levels by the year 2010

 Canada said joint implementation with credit offers the best combination of technology and financial transfer to developing countries and expressed the hope that developing countries would see its potential value

 The group later considered a proposal by JAPAN establishing three categories of Annex I countries

 The proposal was the "big bubble," as suggested at various moments during the negotiations, in particular by Russia

 Several delegations suggested they were not yet ready to accept the quantified emission limitation and reduction commitment in the Chair's draft, which put the EU at -8%, the US, Russia, Canada and Ukraine at -5%, Japan at -4

5%, New Zealand at 0, Australia and Norway at +5% and Iceland at +10%, compared to 1990 levels

 A number of countries including JAPAN, BARBADOS, BRAZIL and COSTA RICA supported Option C

 ICELAND, URUGUAY, CANADA, MEXICO, COSTA RICA and NEW ZEALAND supported the US's concern that Option C refers to only a limited number of activities that can contribute to sinks

 ICELAND called for including restoration of degraded land

 GRENADA suggested giving a negative credit to countries when sinks are destroyed

 NORWAY said limiting a comprehensive use of sinks limits a comprehensive policy approach and creates uncertainties for countries willing to undertake ambitious commitments

 In the 9 December COW, BURKINA FASO, supported by BANGLADESH and UGANDA, called for a reference to an FCCC provision on taking full account of the situations of the least developed countries

 On aggregating emissions of Annex I Parties (paragraph 1), RUSSIA noted that its previously introduced quantitative indicators for limitation of GHG emissions were omitted from Annex B and stated that the Russian target should say 100% of the 1990 base level

 UKRAINE also specified 100% for itself

<p>On a paragraph on deciding the modalities, rules, and guidelines for estimating changes in carbon stocks (paragraph 4), JAPAN proposed adding a sentence specifying that decisions should apply in the second and subsequent commitment periods "unless otherwise decided by the COP serving as the MOP

 The paragraph was later reopened by AUSTRALIA, supported by the PHILIPPINES, who proposed adding "A Party may choose to apply such a decision on categories its first commitment period, provided that these activities are since 1990

<p>On calculations of QELROs for each Annex I Party (paragraph 7), AUSTRALIA noted a previously submitted amendment that "Parties in Annex B for whom land use change and forestry constituted a net source of GHG emissions in 1990 shall include in their 1990 emissions base the aggregate anthropogenic CO2 equivalent emissions minus removals in 1990 from land use change" in calculating their assigned amount

" ICELAND stated that actions taken before 1990 make its 110% target unattainable

 The EU countries are to reduce GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 8%, the US by 7%, Japan by 6%, while countries like Australia and Iceland are allowed increases by 8% and 10%, respectively

<p>SWITZERLAND, supported by HUNGARY, urged SBSTA to further elaborate on the inclusion of bunker fuel emissions in overall GHG inventories

 JAPAN, opposed by the UK, said there were "actual" and "potential" methods of estimating emissions and proposed a new paragraph under which the COP would affirm the "actual" method for including HFC, PFC and SF6 emissions in QELROs

1): Article 10 (Article 12 in the negotiating text) was addressed in a negotiating group co-chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) and Bo Kjellén (Sweden)

 The PHILIPPINES, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, proposed deletion of the text in brackets

<p>Much of the negotiations on the CDM took place in informal bilateral and group discussions lead by the US and Brazil

<p>The PHILIPPINES, supported by the MARSHALL ISLANDS, FRANCE, UGANDA, SAUDI ARABIA, TRINIDAD and TOBAGO, the EU and the NETHERLANDS, proposed deletion of a paragraph stating that certified emissions reductions from 2000 to the beginning of the first commitment period can be used to achieve compliance during that commitment period

 FRANCE said COP-4 should consider the paragraph

 RUSSIA, COSTA RICA, HUNGARY, the US, CROATIA, JAPAN, PERU and POLAND opposed the deletion, as did CANADA, who said joint implementation with credit was an important notion to retain

<p>On 5 December in the COW Plenary, the Chair of the negotiating group on institutions and mechanisms (I&amp;Ms), Takao Shibata (Japan), reported progress in discussions on articles on the MOP/COP

 CANADA introduced an alternative text, stating that commitments under Article 3 would be met in a "cost effective manner" and "in accordance with international rules

<p>INDIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, and supported by CHINA and INDONESIA, reiterated its objection to the concept of emissions trading, stating that it is extraneous to the Berlin Mandate and would not lead to GHG emissions limitation and reduction

 CHINA, supported by INDIA, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN, TOGO, UGANDA, NIGERIA, VIETNAM and the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, proposed deleting the paragraph on emissions trading, along with two subsequent paragraphs on including and subtracting emissions reduction units acquired and transferred, respectively, in each Party's assigned amount (paragraphs 3

 INDIA stressed that trading should be based on equitably allocated entitlements

<p>MEXICO, RUSSIA, ISRAEL, UKRAINE, NAURU, AUSTRALIA, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, ROMANIA, JAPAN, ARGENTINA, SAMOA, NEW ZEALAND, POLAND and SWITZERLAND favored keeping the three paragraphs as drafted

 IRAN suggested that the Secretariat study the concept for future action

 UGANDA, supported by NIGERIA, specified that future COPs should examines the merits of trading

<p>The UK, supported by HUNGARY, TUVALU, GRENADA, SEYCHELLES, ZIMBABWE, the CZECH REPUBLIC, CHILE, URUGUAY, the PHILIPPINES, SLOVENIA, AOSIS, ZAMBIA and COLOMBIA, proposed amending the paragraph to clarify that trading would not be allowed until appropriate rules and guidelines were agreed by the COP

<p>The US stressed its change in position to support for very deep reductions and, with CANADA, ARGENTINA and NEW ZEALAND, proposed that COP-4 define relevant rules and guidelines

 The GAMBIA, MALAWI, KIRIBATI, SAUDI ARABIA, ZAMBIA and IRAN supported deletion of paragraphs 3

 This was supported by KENYA and COSTA RICA

<p>NORWAY and ROMANIA supported developing rules and guidelines for consideration at COP-4

 Supported by UGANDA, the PHILIPPINES, SAUDI ARABIA, ZIMBABWE, ZAMBIA, IRAN and COLOMBIA, INDIA suggested further amending paragraph 3

" ZIMBABWE proposed a reference to a global ceiling for entitlements based on contraction and convergence of emissions, to further address the question of equity

 The US strongly objected to the Indian proposal and said it would make the system unworkable, but suggested that the proposals from India and Zimbabwe contained elements that Parties might wish to address in the future

 COLOMBIA proposed a further amendment on defining rules for equitable allocation of entitlements for emissions trading

 MALAYSIA asked that the issue of emissions trading be referred to the subsidiary bodies

<p>Compensation Fund: On 4 December in Plenary, the Chair of the negotiating group on the proposed compensation fund (Iran) reported that there were still divergent views on the issue and that further consultations were needed

<p>On 6 December, IRAN reported on negotiations on minimizing the adverse effects of climate change through P&amp;Ms

 The US, the EU, POLAND, AUSTRALIA and CANADA said compensation was unacceptable and the paragraph should be deleted

<p>Voluntary Commitments: On 4 December in the COW Plenary, Dámaso Luna (Mexico), reported that further consultations were needed on voluntary commitments for non-Annex I Parties (formerly Article 10)

 In the final COW Plenary, SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, VENEZUELA, EGYPT, the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, SYRIA, MOROCCO, IRAN, BRAZIL, GAMBIA and BANGLADESH called for deletion of this draft article

 INDIA said the article would create a new category of Parties not established in the Convention

 CHINA said although the commitments were voluntary in name they would determine a level of limitation or reduction of anthropogenic emissions, imposing an obligation that did not apply to developing countries

 UGANDA said voluntary commitments would not be voluntary years from now

 ARGENTINA, supported by the UK, proposed additional text that would prohibit arbitrary measures or discrimination against non- Annex I Parties who do not assume voluntary commitments

<p>HUNGARY, GRENADA, RUSSIA, JAPAN and MICRONESIAsupported retaining the article

 ISRAEL supported the article and the amendments proposed

<p>The PHILIPPINES said he supported the concept underpinning the article, but only concerns represented in the amendments could be addressed

 MEXICO said the article in modified form could avoid pressure on non-Annex I countries

 Supported by the US, CANADA, POLAND, SLOVENIA, AUSTRALIA, SWITZERLAND and JAPAN, he introduced a draft text that, inter alia: noted Annex I Party commitments through 2014; considered that future Annex I commitments beyond that date should comprise the widest possible participation in binding action; recognized the dependence of inception of non-Annex I Parties' legally binding emissions limitations commitments on Annex I Parties' implementation, particularly of Kyoto Protocol QELROs; agreed there should be further QELROs for Annex I Parties and "quantified emission limitation objectives" for other Parties, except least developed countries; and established a process to set the commitments, to be concluded by 2002

<p>The G-77/CHINA, supported by THAILAND, SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN, COLOMBIA, MALAYSIA, NICARAGUA, HONDURAS, SYRIA, GHANA, TOGO, LAOS, KUWAIT, GRENADA, BOTSWANA, BAHRAIN, MALI, CHILE, PERU, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, NIGERIA, BANGLADESH, KENYA, MOROCCO, ZIMBABWE, INDONESIA, URUGUAY, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, PHILIPPINES, VENEZUELA, COSTA RICA, GAMBIA, ARGENTINA and SOUTH AFRICA, on behalf of Southern African Development Community (SADC), said equity and common but differentiated responsibilities are keys to success

<p>At approximately 1:00 pm on 11 December, Hiroshi Ohki (Japan) convened the COP-3 closing Plenary to address pending issues in the agenda (FCCC/CP/1997/1), including the adoption of a protocol or legally binding instrument

 NORWAY suggested the inclusion of another sub-paragraph in the decision on the elaboration of modalities and procedures for the effective implementation of an article on a CDM (Article 12)

 In the meantime, the ethical question is condemned to caricature in exchanges within and with the G-77 and China

<p>Throughout the negotiating process the EU, the US and Japan were in constant communication both within the precincts of the Kyoto International Conference Hall and by telephone

" Some tensions emerged when members of the larger EU group (Germany in particular) resisted giving the lead negotiators in the Troika — the UK, Netherlands and Luxembourg — the flexibility they needed to respond rapidly to new positions and red herrings, notably those of the US

 In a clever play, India and China led off a debate on emissions trading, ambushing the US and JUSSCANZ and succeeding in delaying the pace at which trading will come into effect

 Even in the face of China and India's continued resistance, the US and its allies gained considerable ground with the CDM and declarations supporting voluntary participation by Mexico, the Republic of Korea and others

 Originally presented by Brazil as a means of financing projects through penalties for non-compliance, the CDM, as established, will facilitate emission reduction projects in developing countries financed by developed countries

 Their experts provided back-up information and analyses to delegations ready to listen, their communication experts produced press releases in Kyoto and at home within hours of developments, and their traditional activists staged colorful and thought provoking actions ranging from a Friends of the Earth award for the top dirty industries and penguins sculptured in ice, to a procession which raised the specter of the environmental martyrs of the Ogoni people in Nigeria to link human rights to climate change politics

<p>The conceptual model adopted, the so-called "Big Bubble" approach originally suggested by Russia, provided some scope for groups pursuing both approaches to targets — the ambitious and the nervous

 Within hours of the close of the conference the US discovered that Japan had agreed on a lower target than Washington anticipated — sending one lead negotiator hurtling down the aisle towards Estrada to demand an explanation from the man who was largely responsible for cajoling the Annex I Parties into going as far as they did

<p>It is the economic engine rooms of the world — the US, Japan and Europe — who have built their power-bases upon unsustainable technologies and who must now lead the way in reversing the trends they have led

<p>FCCC MEETINGS: The FCCC subsidiary bodies will meet from 2- 12 June 1998 in Bonn, Germany

 In a joint statement issued at the Summit of the Americas in Santiago, the presidents of the US and Chile, inter alia: stressed that the Protocol's market mechanisms would mobilize private sector resources; recognized the potential of the Clean Development Mechanism; and noted that developing countries should participate meaningfully in efforts to address climate change by, for example, taking on emissions targets

<p>On 30 May, the US, France, Britain and others began discussions in Paris on holding one or more international conferences to persuade India and Pakistan to renounce further nuclear testing in return for help from the industrial world in developing civilian nuclear power centers

" He said imposing sanctions on India and Pakistan would make it more difficult for them to switch

 A conference on Climate Change Mitigation in Africa was held in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe from 18-20 May 1998

 Twenty-four African countries were represented at the conference as well as representatives from the UNEP Centre Denmark, Danida, GTZ, UNDP and UNEP

 The Conference was held as part of the final stage of the UNEP/GEF project "Economics of Climate Change Limitation," ran in parallel with the conference for Latin America held in Quito, Ecuador from 21 - 22 May

 Environmental NGOs were concerned that trading will allow wealthy countries to buy permits to emit carbon dioxide that has not been emitted by Russia due to its economic crisis

 (Canada) and Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (US), announced a greenhouse gas emissions trade that the two companies hoped would be a first step towards the creation of a global market and an international trading system

 On 11 March, a climate project in Bolivia was finalized, which participants hoped would become an example of how forest protection projects can be used to offset emissions

 Newspaper accounts reported that European ministers, when signing the Protocol, expressed strong concern that the US, Japan and Russia were violating the spirit of the agreement by pursuing trading rather than domestic reductions

 Following high-level consultations on 22 May, Japan and the EU publicly agreed to pool efforts to convince the US to sign the Protocol and encourage developing countries to reduce emissions

 The PHILIPPINES noted that the activities of other intergovernmental agencies increases confusion between AIJ and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and said the COP is the only body mandated to undertake activities under the FCCC

 MAURITANIA said that it may be helpful to address the mechanisms for implementation of the Protocol separately to avoid blurring the delegates' capacity and making the Secretariat's work difficult

 HUNGARY noted that the soft commitments of 1992 will expire in 2000 and called for elaboration of new commitments undertaken in Kyoto by COP-4

 CHINA warned that the Kyoto Protocol should not copy the Montreal Protocol

 With COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA and IRAN, he noted they are supplemental to domestic action

 SOUTH AFRICA and IRAN noted that COP-4 cannot finalize work on setting modalities and guidelines for the mechanisms

 SLOVENIA reiterated the urgency of action, calling for the proposed working groups to provide sufficient input to COP-4 on the elaboration of modalities, rules and guidelines

<p>AUSTRALIA, supported by RUSSIA, called for cost-effective mechanisms and said that credits should be transferable across the three mechanisms for the achievement of the Protocol's aims

 ARGENTINA stressed the importance of setting COP-4's priorities and suggested moving on those issues, such as the CDM, where consensus has been achieved

 MAURITIUS emphasized CDM for poverty alleviation and ETHIOPIA called for elaboration on this at COP-4

 With COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA, SLOVENIA, SENEGAL, NIGERIA, and IRAN, NORWAY called CDM a tool for sustainable development in non-Annex I countries that should also contribute to climate change objectives

<p>COLOMBIA and VENEZUELA recommended that CDM projects, inter alia, produce real emissions reductions and, with COSTA RICA, accord with host country wishes

 Supported by COSTA RICA, NICARAGUA, ARGENTINA and IRAN, COLOMBIA opposed ignoring sinks, noting that they are also biodiversity deposits

 IRAN distinguished CDM from other mechanisms as a multilateral rather than bilateral mechanism, with international supervision

 URUGUAY called for further definition and contact group discussions

 Several countries, such as BURKINA FASO, NIGERIA and the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, stressed the need to wait until the end of the AIJ pilot phase before drawing conclusions on its viability

 IRAN favored continuation of the AIJ pilot phase and development of guidelines for it

3, paragraph 6, SWITZERLAND, on behalf of Co-Chair José Romero (Switzerland), reported that the contact group met three times

 INDONESIA reported that the G-77/China felt it was premature to try to decide the organization of work until after work on mechanisms and review of adequacy of commitments under FCCC 4

 <p> CLOSING SBI/SBSTA JOINT PLENARY <p>On 12 June, SBSTA Chair Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia) noted there had been many doubts voiced regarding the ability to make progress, but noted that this session resulted in the basic building blocks to move forward on important issues

" SBI Chair Bakary Kante (Senegal) said that delegates had started a process that, while interesting, cannot be completed at once

 ARGENTINA thanked all participants for their diligent work and expressed confidence that COP-4 would be a resounding success

 To borrow a phrase from Sigmund Freud, the question comes down to this: What does a United States Senator want? It has been reported that US Senators believe that India, China and Mexico will determine whether the US will ratify the Kyoto Protocol

 The host country for COP-4, Argentina, is considering "voluntarily" taking on emissions commitments

 When the proposed Article 10, on voluntary commitments, was dropped from the draft Protocol at the final meeting of the Committee of the Whole (COW) in Kyoto, Argentina asked for the item to be included on the COP-4 agenda

 The proposal was lost after opposition from Saudi Arabia and China on the grounds that it was not an issue the COW could take up

 Argentina mistakenly thought that its motion had succeeded and it was not until things were clarified by the FCCC Secretariat earlier this year that the country repeated its request to place voluntary commitments on COP-4's provisional agenda, in writing

 Argentina consulted widely at the subsidiary body meetings to find an agreed formulation but faced overwhelming opposition within the G-77

 Therefore, it is likely that the US and CANADA will be pushing for early resolution

 INDIA recalled that the debate at Kyoto rejected the idea of voluntary commitments, stating it is not implied in the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities

 SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, VENEZUELA and ALGERIA cautioned that discussion of the issue at this stage would be divisive and distract from discussions of compliance and continuing increases in developed countries’ emissions

 BRAZIL described the FCCC as an exercise in burden sharing, recognizing differentiated responsibilities between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties

 He noted that non-Annex I Parties are well ahead in meeting their existing commitments and, with CHINA, cautioned that this item was not intended to promote the FCCC, but to help some countries avoid existing commitments

 ICELAND said this was necessary in small economies because of the high proportional impact of single projects

<p>The MARSHALL ISLANDS, supported by BRAZIL, BARBADOS and TUVALU, said the draft decision would lead to special dispensations prior to the Kyoto Protocol's entry into force and could create an incentive for emissions increases in Annex I countries

 AUSTRALIA recognized the impact of single projects on small economies and supported establishing guidelines and methodologies to specify circumstances under which single projects could be accommodated

<p>COP Rapporteur Maciej Sadowski (POLAND) introduced the report of the COP (FCCC/CP/1998/L

<p>The United States and Argentina stole the show at a Conference marked by an apparent lack of ambition from the outset, with its focus on the production of a work plan to elaborate the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol and pursue the implementation of the UNFCCC

 The key outcomes were determined during the final day of informal negotiations overseen by the COP President, Maria Julia Alsogaray, Secretary of Natural Resources and Sustainable Development of Argentina

<p>This analysis will confine itself to a brief survey of the significance of the Argentina and US initiatives and an assessment of how the debate on the work programme became and was always destined to become more than an exercise in setting important deadlines

<p>it takes two to tango: The United States’ decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol after Argentina stepped out from the ranks of the G-77/China to take on a binding commitment must be seen in the context of one of the first debates of COP-4 – one that touched on a fault line running through the entire UNFCCC since 1995 when the G-77/China was fractured by a decision to establish the Berlin Mandate

 As expected, despite overwhelming opposition at the subsidiary bodies meetings and a pre-COP meeting, Argentina placed an item on voluntary commitments for developing countries on the provisional agenda

<p>With Argentine President Carlos Menem’s announcement, during the second week of the COP, that Argentina would undertake a voluntary commitment to abate its GHG emissions at COP-5, the host country took a further step towards meeting Washington’s requirements

 When asked to identify Parties who might assume voluntary commitments, he said the small island States of Niue and Nauru had expressed interest in a greater level of engagement with the climate change regime

 As the host country and close US ally, Argentina was perfectly situated to break from the ranks of the G-77/China and both facilitate and accelerate an evolution in the UNFCCC process, which has been paralleled by growing interest in the developing world in the CDM

<p>One of the architects of the Kyoto Protocol has suggested that the language of "voluntary commitments" may not survive because the terminology has become has become tainted by the contentious debate between the Umbrella Group (Japan, US, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Norway and New Zealand (JUSSCANNZ) and Russia) and the G-77/China over developing country commitments

 Some countries, such as Indonesia and the Republic of Korea, displayed more willingness to contemplate new commitments before the United States and JUSSCANNZ transformed the issue into a cause celebre

 The attempt by Argentina to place voluntary commitments for developing countries on the COP-4 agenda on day one set a tone of suspicion at the outset

 The G-77/China continues to view the inadequacy of commitments in terms of the poor performance of Annex-I Parties, while developed country Parties insist that the problem is a lack of global participation, particularly by key developing countries such as China and Brazil

<p> FCCC SUBSIDIARY BODIES: The FCCC Subsidiary Bodies will meet from 31 May – 11 June 1999 in Bonn, Germany

 He drew attention to the election at COP-4 of Lambert Gnapelet (Central African Republic) as SBSTA Vice Chair and Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia) as Rapporteur

 He reported the proposal to defer consideration of the impact of single projects on emissions in the commitment period and the scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil (allocation of responsibilities among emitters based on historical emissions) to SBSTA-11

 ICELAND supported this proposal

 <p>SAUDI ARABIA, supported by CHINA and INDIA, said some issues may not be adequately dealt with and suggested SBSTA and SBI jointly address common agenda items

 The US, with JAPAN and GUATEMALA, said experiences gained from AIJ projects could provide valuable lessons for Protocol mechanism development

 GUATEMALA, with BRAZIL, supported AIJ project eligibility for CDM certification, if the project meets the necessary criteria and, with RUSSIA, called for straightforward guidelines for the certification system

 As AIJ does not include a credit element and lacks adequate reference to sustainable development, IRAN opposed linking it with CDM

 <p>The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) reported on a recent CDM workshop held in Dakar, Senegal

 <p>On the Protocol mechanisms, CHINA said the synthesis of proposals on emissions trading contained several extraneous elements, such as competitiveness and market size, and called for a revised synthesis

 The US, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, NORWAY, NEW ZEALAND and CANADA opposed the EU proposal to place caps on the use of the Protocol mechanisms

 SWITZERLAND proposed a post-verification system for emissions trading that allows Parties to trade only the excess of assigned amount units

 Supported by KAZAKHSTAN, he proposed that JI begin prior to 2008

 AOSIS said that actions under the mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic action and, with SENEGAL, indicated that the mechanisms be guided by equity and transparency principles

 CANADA stressed substance, not timing, as the most important consideration and, with POLAND, said it is impractical for and beyond the means of Parties to report on all climate change related policies and measures

 RUSSIA opposed Canada’s suggestion for an annual system of providing inventories, as it would be costly and difficult

 A contact group chaired by Mark Mwandosya (Tanzania) and Jim Penman (UK) will consider this issue further

 POLAND noted that if Parties decide to change inventory methodology, artificial reduction of emissions may occur, and proposed recalculating emissions whenever the COP adopts new or amended emission inventory methodology

<p>On LULUCF, NORWAY said SBSTA-10 can make progress on policy and procedural issues and guide IPCC with its preparation of a Special Report on LULUCF

 AUSTRALIA called for focus on key policy and procedural issues relevant to the negotiating process, and for clarification of the Protocol’s reference to establishing 1990 carbon stock levels

 NIGERIA said the Special Report should include definitions of baselines for carbon stocks in sinks and should ensure that policy options are consistent with other convention requirements

 SAUDI ARABIA, SWITZERLAND, GREENPEACE and others expressed reservations about the proposed timing for deliberation on some issues, noting the relevance of the Special Report

 SWITZERLAND stressed the need to introduce more stringent regulations, improve air traffic management nationally and internationally and use economic instruments such as eliminating tax privileges on aviation fuel

 CANADA said the first task is stocktaking of the compliance-related elements and, with NEW ZEALAND and the US, underscored the importance of tracking other groups’ work

 JAPAN highlighted the importance of examining other multilateral environmental agreements

 RUSSIA called for a well-defined legal interpretation of compliance

 CHINA proposed including a reference to "principles" in the agenda

<p>On identification of compliance-related elements and gaps, the US, with CANADA and the EU, indicated the need to differentiate elements from gaps and proposed three categories to identify them: substantive rules; procedures for addressing compliance; and consequences of non-compliance

 JAPAN noted that although expert review teams were useful in assessing implementation, determining non-compliance was not within their mandate

 AUSTRALIA and other delegations noted the need for continuous feedback between the JWG and other contact groups to avoid overlap and contradictions on substantive rules

<p>The contact group chaired by Paul Maclons (South Africa) and Maciej Sadowski (Poland) met in the evening to consider LULUCF issues, including policy and procedural matters and data to establish 1990 carbon stock levels

 A contact group co-chaired by Jim Penman (UK) and Mark Mwandosya (Tanzania) met in the afternoon to consider text on draft guidelines for the preparation of Annex I communications

 The EU, supported by the US, CANADA and RUSSIA, suggested that the Secretariat could prepare several other options for a draft budget

 The US and CANADA preferred resolving the issue at this session, given COP-5’s heavy workload

 CANADA emphasized that the Secretariat should focus on its facilitative function

 IRAN suggested that the Secretariat provide at least two reports on biennium budgets, thus allowing later drafts to take into account additional expenses resulting from COP decisions

 The PHILIPPINES noted that a budget increase does not necessarily benefit the Parties

 <p>In reference to certain programme activities outlined in the budget, CHINA stated that the Secretariat was not mandated to provide policy guidance to Parties but rather the other way around

 <p>Mohammed Reza Salamat (Iran) reported on informal consultations on the terms of reference for a workshop envisaged on implementation of Articles 4

 The US also emphasized the importance of transparency and, with JAPAN, called for reasonable certainty about consequences for non- compliance

 AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the US called for a regime tailored to the Kyoto Protocol, as it differs from other multilateral environmental agreements

 JAPAN said the system may need a short grace period at the end of commitment period

 IRAN noted that Protocol Article 18 (non-compliance) does not specify any particular articles, but applies to the entire Protocol

 AOSIS cautioned against attempting to differentiate legally binding from non-legally binding obligations, and IRAN underscored the legally binding character of the Protocol as a whole

 CHINA said Article 18 applies to all obligations of the Protocol

 AUSTRALIA said a distinction between binding and non- binding aspects would be necessary for practical reasons

 AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, opposed by the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, stressed the usefulness of peer reviews, rather than a punitive regime, to enforce obligations

 The EU, supported by JAPAN and AOSIS, noted its preference for a system that combines “hard” and “soft” enforcement measures that are graded according to the gravity of the breach and the nature of the obligation

 CANADA referred to procedural steps leading to the application of consequences as an integral part of the compliance system

 <p> AUSTRALIA noted that the group's consideration of the charts had clarified issues and would help advance negotiations

 With CANADA and NEW ZEALAND, he suggested incorporating these new ideas into revised draft conclusions

 The PHILIPPINES said enabling activities went beyond capacity building and highlighted the importance of identifying difficulties faced by non-Annex I countries such as the lack of financial resources and technology to, inter alia, gather data for national communications

 UGANDA and LAOS pointed to the need for capacity building on GEF procedures, including for the implementing agencies in the field

 GEORGIA suggested that CDM activities be a component of second non-Annex I communications and called for capacity building to achieve this

 JAPAN accepted most of the G-77/CHINA’s suggestions, except on timing for the high-level segment

 <p>The NETHERLANDS announced its offer to host COP-6 in the Hague and said it was up to Parties to decide whether it should take place in 2000 or 2001

 AUSTRALIA said that since COP-6 had important decisions to take it should be held early in 2001

 CANADA noted the importance of setting the technical foundation of decisions on issues such as technology transfer, the mechanisms and compliance

 KUWAIT and LEBANON stressed that the COPs should be held on a yearly basis

 The EU expressed its flexibility on the timing of COP-6 but underscored the need for a prompt decision to permit the Netherlands sufficient time for preparations

 <p> CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS <p><i>Emissions from international transport:</i> Jose Romero (Switzerland) conducted informal consultations on the draft conclusions on emissions resulting from fuel used for international transportation

 NORWAY, on behalf of the Umbrella Group (a fluid grouping of non-EU Annex I countries), expressed regret that G-77/China was not prepared

 <p>Regarding the draft decision on guidelines and the schedule, the group accepted a number of amendments, including, inter alia: a preambular sentence proposed by Switzerland noting the ongoing process of improvement in reporting guidance to Parties, particularly through the IPCC’s work on uncertainties and good practice in managing inventories; and the EU’s insertion of “annual” inventory reporting

 TOGO noted that it was premature to think about guidelines for second communications as most non- Annex I countries were still preparing their first

 MEXICO said financial support should be available not only for vulnerability assessment but also for mitigation and adaptation efforts

 SWITZERLAND emphasized the need to identify problems with the preparation of inventories

 CHINA, supported by the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, said important decisions sometimes have to be reiterated until they are implemented

<p>On a deadline for Parties to respond to a questionnaire on compliance, Co-Chair Dovland (Norway) noted that the 15 August 1999 deadline was intended to allow Parties as much time as possible but would render translation of documents in time for COP-5 impossible

 SWITZERLAND proposed including a reference to Decision 8/CP

<p>On the nature and timing of the proposed informal exchange of information, the G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA and IRAN, preferred holding it after COP-5, but before the twelfth sessions of the subsidiary bodies (SB-12)

 SWITZERLAND suggested the co-chairs develop terms of reference for the informal discussions

 The EU, CANADA, the US and AUSTRALIA supported holding it prior to COP-5 in order to better prepare for and participate more fully in that meeting

 AUSTRALIA noted that the Protocol is breaking new ground in international law and recommended examining other compliance models

 CANADA said the discussions would allow more effective use of scarce time and resources and, with the EU, said it would provide an opportunity for "mutual learning

 CHINA identified issues missing from the Secretariat’s synthesis report but covered in the G-77/China paper, including transparency and climate change effectiveness

 PERU recommended a common baseline for joint implementation and the CDM

 NORWAY, supported by CANADA, said operational entities were a key element for CDM institutional structure

 NORWAY noted that there was no section on baselines in the synthesis report

 NORWAY proposed that this be determined under project registration

 CHINA suggested applying a similar condition to the funding country to confirm how a CDM would result in certified emissions reductions (CERs)

<p>On sequestration, CANADA, supported by NORWAY and IRAN, proposed addressing this under project eligibility

 Supported by PERU, he said capacity building should be incorporated into all CDM projects to enhance endogenous expertise to identify technology needs and capacities for assimilation of technology

 SWITZERLAND inquired about a date for early crediting noting the lack of clarity in the case of joint implementation (JI)

 JAPAN noted areas of convergence in the proposals submitted on environmental and cost effectiveness, equity and transparency

 JAPAN stated that the term "operational entities" was unique to CDM and could not be used when discussing JI

 JAPAN preferred addressing initiation of JI projects along with project eligibility and said many countries did not concur with the two-step approach

 The PHILIPPINES distinguished emissions trading from other mechanisms and stressed that it did not imply a right to pollute but an obligation to reduce greenhouse gases

 The EU identified divergence on interchangeability between CERs and ERUs, and, with JAPAN, noted convergence on cost effectiveness, environmental benefits, equity and transparency

<p>On the definition of units, CANADA noted divergence on the concept of fungibility among the Protocol mechanisms

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>INFORMAL EXCHANGE OF VIEWS AND INFORMATION ON COMPLIANCE UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL: </i>The informal exchange of views and information on compliance under the Protocol was held from 6 - 7 October 1999 in Vienna, Austria

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>INFORMAL MINISTERIAL CONSULTATIONS:</i> Informal ministerial consultations were held in Warsaw, Poland on 20 September 1999

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>WORKSHOP ON EMISSION FACTORS AND ACTIVITY DATA FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) INVENTORIES: </i>The FCCC Secretariat convened the second Workshop on Emission Factors and Activity Data for the Improvement of GHG Inventories from 6 - 8 August 1999 in Accra, Ghana, to provide a forum for the exchange of experiences in the development of emission factors and activity data for the estimation of inventories

 Two working groups, one on the LULUCF, the other on the energy sector, reassessed and confirmed the related key sectoral issues identified at an earlier workshop held in Cuba

 Over 50 participants attended, including country representatives from small island states, experts from various UN and regional organizations, an environmental NGO representative and special invitees from the Philippines, Mauritania, the US, the UK, Australia, Norway, New Zealand and Switzerland

<p class="MsoNormal">Jan Szyszko, Minister of Environmental Protection, Natural Resources and Forestry, Poland, was elected President of COP-5

<p class="MsoNormal">Gerhard Schröder, Federal Chancellor of Germany, said the vision for sustainable development articulated at the Rio Summit had not become a reality as quickly as hoped

 The Vice-Presidents elected were: Papa Cham (The Gambia), Phillip Gwage (Uganda), Mohamed Al-Sabban (Saudi Arabia), Liu Zhenmin (China), Olexander Bielov (Ukraine), Yvo De Boer (Netherlands), Neroni Slade (Samoa)

 The COP elected Antonio Vallini Guerreiro (Brazil) as Rapporteur, John Ashe (Antigua &amp; Barbuda) as Chair of SBI and Harald Dovland (Norway) as Chair of SBSTA

<p class="MsoNormal">SBI Chair John Ashe introduced Vice Chair Mohammed Reza Salamat (Iran) and Rapporteur Klaus Radunsky (Austria)

 SWITZERLAND, with the EU and AUSTRALIA, supported adopting the guidelines at COP-5

 AUSTRALIA said the guidelines may be applicable to Protocol inventories

 The EU, opposed by CHINA, said the GEF had provided most non-Annex I Parties with funding for national communications

 UZBEKISTAN noted that constraints included lack of research and data on emissions factors

 IRAN noted that countries also have needs determined by their unique circumstances

 The EU, CANADA and MICRONESIA noted the usefulness of the compilation and synthesis report in better understanding the difficulties faced by non-Annex I Parties

 SWITZERLAND said there is a need for one unified reporting format for all FCCC Parties and for the use of IPCC guidelines

 ARGENTINA supported regional groups of experts

 The US, supported by CANADA and SWITZERLAND and opposed by CHINA, said the revision of guidelines was fundamental to improving second national communications

 Lambert Gnapelet (Central African Republic) and Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia) were re-elected as SBSTA Vice-Chair and Rapporteur respectively

 Regarding the draft guidance for reporting on Global Climate Observation Systems (GCOS), the EU, with MONGOLIA, recommended that Annex I Parties prepare separate reports on global climate observation and include in their national communications a summary based on general reporting requirements

 AUSTRALIA suggested that projections of the effect of policies and measures on future trends of GHG emissions and removals be developed by sector

 The MARSHALL ISLANDS and JAMAICA supported detailed and rigorous reporting

 A contact group chaired by Jim Penman (UK) and Mark Mwandosya (Tanzania) will meet to consider this issue

<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>JAPAN, with AUSTRALIA, called for the establishment of a decision-making framework at COP-5

 AUSTRALIA stressed that the key question is not “whether” but “how” additional sink activities could be included in the Protocol

 CANADA said the decision-making framework should be based on consistency between the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol

<p class="MsoNormal">Regarding guidelines for national systems, the EU, with JAPAN, said they should be flexible in order to reflect different national circumstances

 AUSTRALIA proposed including, inter alia, quality assurance and quality control procedures, links between national systems and emissions trading systems and links with the transfer and acquisition of assigned amounts

 SWITZERLAND said guidelines should include criteria for national enforcement systems to comply with relevant guidelines, and the establishment and treatment of data related to Protocol mechanisms

<p class="MsoNormal">Regarding adjustments, AUSTRALIA said they are intended as an element of the Protocolï¿½s compliance system

 The EU and JAPAN stated that further discussion on technical aspects should only occur after the completion of IPCCï¿½s work on good practice

 CANADA noted the lack of clarity in what an adjustment would be

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>ADVERSE EFFECTS:</i> Former SBSTA Chair Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia) reported on a workshop on implementation of FCCC Articles 4

 AUSTRALIA, with CANADA and the GAMBIA, said the absence of information on the effect of policies and measures should not be an obstacle to meeting the needs of the truly vulnerable

 CANADA and SAMOA highlighted the need to act through the national communications process

 SENEGAL called for an evaluation of vulnerability in Africa by COP-6

<p class="MsoNormal">On the impact of response measures on the economies of oil producing and other countries, SAUDI ARABIA referred to recent studies suggesting oil producing countries will suffer economically from response measures and, with KUWAIT and LIBYA, said developed countries should remove market distortions in the energy sector

 JAPAN and the MARSHALL ISLANDS said consideration of compensation was unacceptable as it is not provided for in the FCCC or the Protocol

<p class="MsoNormal">On the status of negotiations, several delegates, including SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, QATAR and the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, said equal progress must be made on all issues, and the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) should be achieved as a complete package

 UGANDA, BURKINA FASO, the MARSHALL ISLANDS and SAMOA said not all issues could be advanced simultaneously and stated that waiting for a package would delay action

 BANGLADESH suggested that the GEF establish a separate fund to meet these countries’ needs

<p class="MsoNormal">On recipients of capacity building, the G77/CHINA said these are developing countries only, while the EU, KAZAKHSTAN and others said it included countries with economies in transition

<p class="MsoNormal">The MARSHALL ISLANDS with the SUDAN, the GAMBIA, AOSIS and CHINA said the process had to be country driven rather than agency driven and must follow the guidance of the COP

 The PHILIPPINES recommended that capacity building be “for,” “by” and “in” developing countries and said the GEF initiative was the antithesis of capacity building

 CANADA, supporting the GEF initiative, urged the GEF to further develop its interagency approach

 CANADA supported a coordinated response among existing efforts in capacity building and proposed three steps: assessment of needs; overview of actions currently undertaken by various actors; and definition of a clear scope for action

 AUSTRALIA sought information from the Secretariat on current support for developing countries in order to identify gaps and needs for future work

 NORWAY favored an integrated approach for the identification of needs

 SWITZERLAND endorsed a practical approach focused on identifying appropriate needs in specific areas

 AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN and UZBEKISTAN said that capacity building was necessary to take full advantage of the clean development mechanism (CDM)

 With the MARSHALL ISLANDS, BOTSWANA and SAMOA, he opposed linking AIJ to the Protocol mechanisms

 JAPAN, supported by the EU, said the experience gained is sufficient for a comprehensive review

 With POLAND, he stressed that an AIJ project should be eligible under joint implementation (JI) or CDM if it meets the criteria for eligibility and if the Parties involved agree

<p class="MsoNormal">Opposed by AOSIS, BOTSWANA and IRAN, the EU, with SWITZERLAND, proposed that AIJ should be credited retroactively

 SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA said that without credit, industries would be cautious about AIJ

 BOTSWANA said introducing crediting would confuse the process

<p class="MsoNormal">On the reporting format, SWITZERLAND stressed simplicity

 A contact group will be convened chaired by Yvo de Boer (Netherlands)

 AUSTRALIA noted the need for considerable technical work prior to COP-6

 With NORWAY and SWITZERLAND, he suggested refining the synthesis into a draft negotiating text

 NORWAY further identified the need to decide on a work plan in the run-up to COP-6

 AOSIS highlighted the need for the mechanisms to be based on sound environmental principles and, with VENEZUELA, called for adequate time for consideration

 UZBEKISTAN, with the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, sought clear definitions of core concepts

 CHINA opposed taking a single decision on all mechanisms as this was not supported by the Protocol

 Turkey’s proposal to be removed from the Annexes was supported by PAKISTAN, the US, MEXICO and GEORGIA

 AUSTRALIA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION said no information requirements were placed on initial members of Annex I

 KAZAKHSTAN expressed willingness to provide the required information

 SUDAN called for guidelines on amending the Annexes

 INDIA, with CHINA and IRAN, recommended the use of Article 4

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS: </i>On GHG inventory data for Annex I communications, the US, with POLAND, stressed that timeliness and completeness of submissions were critical in providing a basis for COP action

 In view of the workload to meet the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA), the US, with CANADA, AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND, said COP-6 should be held early in 2001 with various intersessional activities on the run-up

 CHINA said the BAPA only calls for “demonstrable progress” by COP-6

 To maintain political momentum, JAPAN noted its preference for COP-6 in November 2000

 SWITZERLAND said timing of COP-6 should result from progress on pending issues and highlighted the need for a work-plan

 AUSTRALIA, the US and the EU highlighted the potential role of the clean development mechanism (CDM) in technology transfer

 The PHILIPPINES, with SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA, stressed that technology transfer was a commitment under the FCCC and opposed linking it to the CDM

 CHINA said technology transfer under the Protocol should be additional to that under the FCCC

 The PHILIPPINES called for information on technology transfer activities in Annex-I communications

 SWITZERLAND underscored consideration of specific national circumstances

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS: </i>Regarding “best practices” in policies and measures (P&amp;Ms), Chair Dovland announced that Denmark will host a workshop in April 2000

 AUSTRALIA preferred reference to “good” rather than “best” practices and, with JAPAN and the US, said P&amp;Ms should reflect national circumstances

 The REPUBLIC OF KOREA, supported by AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND and JAPAN, said it was premature to discuss allocation due to the difficulties in differentiating emissions resulting from national and international fuel

 Jose Romero (Switzerland) will conduct informal consultations on this issue

<p class="MsoNormal">On the impact of single projects on emissions in the commitment period, ICELAND said single projects have a greater proportional impact on emissions in smaller countries, affecting their ability to meet emissions targets

 CANADA expressed reservations on the issue and opposed the draft decision tabled by Iceland at COP-4 in its current form

 Informal consultations will be conducted by Ole Plougmann (Denmark) to forward conclusions or a draft decision to SBSTA

<p class="MsoNormal">Regarding the scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal from Brazil , several delegates supported the concept of differentiated responsibilities, while a number noted that further scientific analysis would be useful

 The EU and PERU, opposed by MALAYSIA, said the issue should be considered as part of IPCC’s Third Assessment Report

 The PHILIPPINES and CHINA recommended consideration of the G-77/China capacity-building draft decision

 UGANDA proposed a permanent clearing-house to streamline funding

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>LULUCF: </i>The contact group, co-chaired by Halldor Thorgeirsson (Iceland) and Philip Gwage (Uganda), expressed diverging views on timing for consideration of the need for country-specific data and information and its relationship to a decision-making framework in the context of the Protocol

 ARGENTINA, supported by KENYA, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and POLAND, called for attention to the medical use of HFCs in metered dose inhalers

 JAPAN encouraged GCOS, in cooperation with the WMO, to monitor the status of implementation with a view to utilizing recent technologies to fill the gaps in climate observing systems

 AUSTRALIA called for a more diversified funding strategy

 Susan Barrell (Australia) will conduct informal consultations on this issue

 While the EU objected, CANADA supported additional rosters for inventory reviews

 In presenting its preliminary views, JAPAN proposed a single compliance body and outlined steps ranging from assistance to recommendations to be exhausted before the entry into force of consequences

 CANADA said sufficient evidence should be provided to support cases

 IRAN said only a group of Parties could trigger a case of another Party’s compliance

 The EU, CANADA, CHINA, JAPAN, IRAN, SOUTH AFRICA and the US opposed a triggering role for the Secretariat

 CANADA said the reports were the factual basis that determined the need for further steps

 CHINA, with IRAN, KUWAIT, BRAZIL and ARGENTINA said it was inappropriate to give ERTs, a simple fact finding body, a triggering role

 The US and AUSTRALIA suggested guidelines for a possible referral to the compliance body

 SWITZERLAND, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and CHINA proposed that the COP/MOP should have a triggering role as well as the competence to decide on the findings of the compliance body

 BRAZIL suggested that the COP/MOP only take note of the compliance body report

<p class="MsoNormal">On sources of information, AUSTRALIA and the US said that due process required the defending party to be able to present necessary information and rebut evidence against it

 SAMOA suggested any source the compliance body deemed appropriate, while IRAN said Parties should be the only source

 BRAZIL said sources should bear responsibility for their information

<p class="MsoNormal">The EU, with BRAZIL, stressed the need to ensure confidentiality of information submitted in confidence by Parties

 CHINA sought criteria for the use of information

 IRAN raised the issue of financing developing countries’ efforts to provide information

 Co-chairs Salamat (Iran) and Kjellén (Sweden) suggested that the discussion’s purpose was to provide further information to enable them to propose a draft text to the contact group

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>MECHANISMS: </i>Chair Chow (Malaysia) took the participants through the Synthesis of Parties’ Proposals on Mechanisms (FCCC/SB/1999/8)

 The EU, NORWAY and the US suggested ways of consolidating and tightening the text

 JAPAN presented an alternative draft of the annex, which he said aimed at greater clarity

 Chair El Ghaouth (Mauritania) noted that he had undertaken informal consultations and said the text did not intend to exclude country positions

 SBSTA Chair Dovland (Norway) urged the Parties to intensify their efforts to reach agreement on these issues

 The EU said meetings should be held regularly, and SWITZERLAND suggested it meet at least once a year, given the continuous work of the compliance body

 POLAND said there should be an equal number of Protocol Annex B and non-Annex B Parties, and AUSTRALIA, supported by the US, added that the composition would depend upon the article under review

 SWITZERLAND, with SOUTH AFRICA, said it should be possible to call on outside experts

 The EU said these rules should be adopted by the body itself, while KUWAIT, BRAZIL and CHINA said the COP/MOP should adopt these rules

<p class="MsoNormal">On the consequences of non-compliance, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the US said the term “consequence” could be replaced by “outcome,” in order to better reflect the possible use of facilitative measures

 CHINA, with SOUTH AFRICA, specified that Protocol Article 18 (compliance) refers to “binding consequences” and opposed the proposed terminology change

 JAPAN said the cost of sanctions should be lower than the cost of withdrawal from the Protocol

 The US, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA and CANADA said a possible sanction could be the subtraction of excess emissions from the levels permitted during the subsequent period, with a penalty rate applied

 SWITZERLAND, BRAZIL and IRAN supported financial penalties as a last resort

 AUSTRALIA said the Party concerned should have the option to choose from a menu of consequences

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>AIJ:</i> Chair de Boer (Netherlands) presented an overview of the Chair’s proposal for a draft decision on AIJ

 CHINA, INDONESIA and IRAN highlighted the need to convene intersessional meetings to strengthen intergovernmental work

 JAPAN and CANADA said both technical workshops and intersessional meetings should be held prior to COP-6

 CANADA added that it would like to see a refined negotiating text at COP-6

 SUDAN said Parties needed time to review the information and findings of technical workshops

” JAPAN, the US and AUSTRALIA defined it as a living document that would go through several drafts

1 (national systems for GHG emissions and removals) that had been presented by JAPAN and amended after informal consultations by a smaller group of Parties

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS:</i> Chair El Ghaouth (Mauritania) informed delegates that a drafting group had been working on a draft text compiling proposals by the EU, the G-77/CHINA and others, and suggested that the contact group adjourn to allow the drafting group to continue its work

 SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA, the US, NIGERIA and BRAZIL said the paper developed by the Co-Chairs should be based on more sources of information

 CHINA, IRAN and SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by the EU and AUSTRALIA, suggested that the paper serve as a basis for “consideration” of compliance

 NIGERIA added that nothing in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) required the JWG to finish its work by COP-6

 NEW ZEALAND, with AUSTRALIA, ARGENTINA, the US, the EU, BAHAMAS, CHILE and the FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA, sought to retain the phrase “complete its work,” as Parties had a responsibility to achieve the objectives of the BAPA and it would be difficult to justify a less ambitious goal

 CHINA, NIGERIA and SAUDI ARABIA sought alternative language supporting substantial progress by COP-6

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>AIJ: </i> Chair de Boer (Netherlands) introduced draft conclusions on “learning by doing” and capacity building, geographic distribution, and additional project incentives

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>ADVERSE EFFECTS: </i> Co-Chair Salamat (Iran) presented the Co-Chairs’ draft decision on the implementation of FCCC Articles 4

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>LULUCF:</i> Co-Chairs Thorgeirsson (Iceland) and Gwage (Uganda) informed the group of a draft decision they had prepared on LULUCF-related methodological issues, including aspects relating to submissions by Parties on: definitions and activities on Protocol Article 3

 AUSTRALIA said the CDM should be largely private sector driven

 NORWAY inquired about the role of operational entities in the validation and pre-registration of project proposals, noting that the Executive Board may not be able to carry out this task

<p class="MsoNormal">SOUTH AFRICA, the SUDAN, BOLIVIA, MEXICO and MAURITANIA suggested that the CDM include the concept of emissions avoidance

 BOLIVIA proposed including forest protection initiatives under emissions avoidance

 MEXICO said he looked forward to using the CDM to supplement national efforts to shift from slash-and-burn techniques, which are responsible for loss of forest cover, to sustainable technologies that would have a positive impact on climate change

 MAURITANIA objected to the inclusion of forest protection within the CDM, as Parties would seek to protect their forests regardless of its inclusion

 IRAN said the CDM should include projects related to both sinks and sources

 MOROCCO stressed the need to certify that reduced or avoided emissions are real, measurable and contribute to sustainable development in the host country

 With SWITZERLAND, she said CDM projects should be subjected to rigorous impact assessment studies that take into account the socio-economic aspects of the host country

<p class="MsoNormal">On the financing of CDM projects, Chair Chow (Malaysia) queried whether the funding will be bilateral, multilateral or unilateral; if ODA and the FCCC’s financial mechanisms could fund CDM activities; or if CDM funds will be managed by the Executive Board, so as to ensure equitable distribution

 MAURITANIA asked how transparency of and accountability for the investment will be ensured

<p class="MsoNormal">On unilateral funding of CDM projects, JAPAN asked whether unilaterally-funded projects were consistent with the concept of CDM

 COLOMBIA highlighted the potential of indigenous private sector projects

 JAPAN said there were no provisions requiring financial additionality and none that preclude the use of ODA as a source of funding

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS:</i> Chair El Ghaouth (Mauritania) suggested that work on a draft decision on matters related to the consideration of non-Annex I communications continue in the drafting group

<p class="MsoNormal">On “best practices” in policies and measures relating to Annex I communications, Chair Dovland (Norway) said further informal consultations would continue, as agreement on draft conclusions had not been reached

 Delegates also adopted draft conclusions on scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L

 AUSTRALIA, the US and the EU supported the calendar of events

 INDIA and CHINA proposed deletion of a paragraph that calls on the CG to consider steps taken or envisaged by the Party to implement the FCCC

 A number of delegates agreed to work on the basis of the Co-Chairs’ proposals, while SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT and the UAE said these drafts did not reflect their concerns and sought to proceed on the basis of an earlier version

<p class="MsoNormal">On a paragraph in the draft conclusions outlining progress at SB-10 and SB-11, AUSTRALIA and the US suggested replacing “procedures and mechanisms” relating to a compliance system with “procedures and processes,” in order to include consideration of Protocol Articles 8 (expert review teams) and 16 (dispute settlement)

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>ADVERSE EFFECTS:</i> Co-Chairs Kjellén (Sweden) and Salamat (Iran) introduced a revised draft decision on FCCC Articles 4

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>MECHANISMS:</i> On CDM project monitoring, MAURITANIA said monitoring and reporting should not burden the host country

 BOLIVIA suggested that Parties monitor their own projects and ï¿½learn by doing

ï¿½ NORWAY and AUSTRALIA said that project participants, the host Party or a designated legal entity should monitor

 On Article 6 project validation, JAPAN cautioned against creating unnecessary bureaucracies

 CANADA and the US noted that Protocol Article 8 (review of information) provides a built-in review

<p class="MsoNormal">Statements by observer States, IGOs, NGOs and UN bodies: On progress made in climate change negotiations, PALAU said it was disappointed at the lack of progress being made at COP-5

<p class="MsoNormal">Protocol ratification: Numerous Parties supported the Protocol’s entry into force by Rio+10, 2002, including, inter alia: BULGARIA, CARICOM, the EU, FRANCE, GERMANY, HAITI, IRELAND, ITALY, JAPAN, SPAIN, SWEDEN, and the UK

 SLOVAKIA, on behalf of the VISEGRAD Group of central European countries, said rules on JI and CDM should enter the implementing phase simultaneously

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>AIJ:</i> The G-77/CHINA supported the continuation of the pilot phase and, with ZAMBIA, highlighted the imbalance in the geographical distribution of AIJ projects

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Adverse effects:</i> The G-77/CHINA, NEPAL and others said developing countries are the most affected by climate change, and Annex I countries must implement their commitments relating to provision of financial resources and technology transfer

 ARGENTINA announced that it had adopted a voluntary target to reduce its GHG emissions, noting that it does not intend to abandon its status as a non-Annex I Party

 KAZAKHSTAN said it intended to join FCCC Annex I

 JAPAN, the US, AUSTRALIA and others welcomed the initiatives by Kazakhstan and Argentina

 CHINA and INDIA said Annex I countries have the main responsibility

 CHINA said it would not undertake commitments until it achieves a “medium development level

 BANGLADESH called on Parties to earmark funds from the GEF for LDCs

 GERMANY urged donor countries to provide the financial means to assure the operations of the GEF

 SWITZERLAND suggested a ï¿½post-verification modelï¿½ wherein emission reduction units could not be transferred until they have been certified to be excess Assigned Amount Units

 BHUTAN and BANGLADESH called for special attention to LDCs’ needs

 SWITZERLAND, JAPAN and the NETHERLANDS urged Parties not to wait for ratification before starting to implement actions to address climate change

<p class="MsoNormal">On lessons learned, FINLAND, with CANADA, underscored good working relationships between all partners and stakeholders in implementing climate change policies

 With SWITZERLAND and HUNGARY, she emphasized the need for increased domestic action and called for continuation of AIJ and a smooth transition in the future to the clean development mechanism (CDM) and joint implementation (JI)

<p class="MsoNormal">The PHILIPPINES and CANADA recommended the use of no-regrets policies

 MALAYSIA and MEXICO sought consistency in policies between different environmental fora

 BULGARIA called for a meeting to address the specific features of countries with economies in transition (EITs) before COP-6

 GERMANY said addressing climate change could create new jobs

 IRAN highlighted the need for confidence-building between developed and developing countries through concrete practical cooperation

 CHINA said attempts by some Parties to get developing countries to “meaningfully participate” were destroying confidence-building efforts between developing and developed countries

<p class="MsoNormal">On outcomes from COP-5, the UK, supported by KAZAKHSTAN and the US, and opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed a Bonn Declaration reaffirming the political will to complete the BAPA by COP-6

 KUWAIT said the proposal for a Bonn Declaration was premature

 ARGENTINA, supported by FINLAND and BENIN, said innovative approaches were needed and called for the establishment of small task forces in the run-up to COP-6

<p class="MsoNormal">JAPAN, supported by KAZAKHSTAN, BOTSWANA, the US, CANADA, BENIN, ICELAND, HONDURAS and SOUTH AFRICA, suggested that COP-5 President Szyszko (Poland) be empowered to appoint a special facilitator to assist negotiations and help Parties realize the BAPA by COP-6

 BELGIUM supported a flexible approach focused on achieving successful outcomes and said a COW or another new structure should be transparent and monitored by all Parties

<p class="MsoNormal">CHINA, with SAUDI ARABIA, VENEZUELA, KUWAIT, INDONESIA, and LIBYA, opposed the proposals to establish new groups or mechanisms to assist progress toward COP-6, stressing that the existing FCCC bodies and structures should be employed to this end

 CHINA, supported by KUWAIT and others, said a facilitator would not be able to visit and confer with all Parties

 NORWAY said ministers should be engaged in the process between the COPs

 The UK, CHILE, MICRONESIA, COOK ISLANDS, SWITZERLAND, the US, TUVALU, AOSIS, CANADA, JAPAN, AUSTRIA, KIRIBATI, the EU, NEW ZEALAND, FRANCE, the GAMBIA, BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA, AUSTRALIA, SLOVENIA, NORWAY, POLAND, BELGIUM and GERMANY supported the adoption of the Co-Chairs’ draft decision in its current form

 QATAR, KUWAIT, the SUDAN, VENEZUELA, SAUDI ARABIA, LIBYA, ALGERIA, NIGERIA, SYRIA, OMAN and JORDAN suggested alternative language whereby the JWG would report to COP-6 “with a view” to adopting a decision on a compliance system, as this would be more consistent with the BAPA

 IRAN requested SAUDI ARABIA and the countries on whose behalf it spoke to join the consensus

<p class="MsoNormal">The Chair of the contact group on non-Annex I communications, Mohamed Ould el Ghaouth (Mauritania), introduced amendments to the decision on non-Annex I communications (FCCC/SBI/1999/CRP

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>LULUCF: </i>SBSTA Chair Dovland (Norway) recalled that delegates had already adopted most of the draft conclusions and said that the new document (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/ CRP

 The EU, with AUSTRALIA and CANADA, opposed it as the GEF would not be able to provide the support the IPCC required

 CHINA said the GEF ï¿½cakeï¿½ was barely enough to go around 130 developing countries

 BRAZIL favored the reference as the GEF was the FCCC financial mechanism and a significant proportion of the IPCCï¿½s finances are used to finance developing country participation

<p class="MsoNormal">Although Ministers at the high-level segment agreed on the need to intensify efforts in preparing for COP-6, a proposal by Japan to establish a facilitator to assist the COP-5 President in undertaking consultations and maintaining the necessary political momentum was met with mixed feelings in the corridors

<p class="MsoNormal">COP-5 President Jan Szyszko (Poland) offered his personal impressions of the high-level segment

<p class="MsoNormal">President Szyszko reported that he was still conducting consultations on proposals from Turkey and Kazakhstan to amend the lists in Annexes I and II of the FCCC

9), the COP decided to accept the invitation of the Netherlands to host the COP

 The NETHERLANDS noted the high expectations set for COP-6 and said that its success will lie in producing a package addressing the concerns of all Parties

1), were adopted after CHINA amended the text to state that the purpose of the technical review is to assist “Annex I Parties” instead of “all Parties” in gaining experience relevant to the preparation of guidelines related to Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8

 Contact group Chair Chow (Malaysia) suggested that a working paper prepared by him and with no official status could assist Parties in making further proposals

<p class="MsoNormal">COP-5 took note of the draft conclusions on the scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L

<p class="MsoNormal">The Fifth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP-5) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) met in Bonn, Germany, from 25 October - 5 November 1999

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>COP-3:</i> The Third Conference of the Parties (COP-3) was held from 1-11 December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>COP-4: </i>The Fourth Conference of the Parties (COP-4) was held from 2-13 November 1998 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with over 5,000 participants in attendance

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>SBI-10 AND SBSTA-10: </i>The FCCC subsidiary bodies held their tenth sessions in Bonn, Germany, from 31 May - 11 June 1999, and began the process of fulfilling the BAPA

<p class="MsoNormal">COP-4 President Maria Julia Alsogaray (Argentina) opened COP-5 on Monday, 25 October 1999, and emphasized the need for political will to fulfill the BAPA and allow for the Protocol to enter into force by Rio+10 in 2002

 The Vice Presidents elected were: Liu Zhenmin (China), Papa Cham (the Gambia), Yvo de Boer (Netherlands), Tuiloma Neroni Slade (Samoa), Mohammad Salem Al-Sabban (Saudi Arabia), Philip Gwage (Uganda), and Olexander Bielov (Ukraine)

 The COP elected Antonio José Vallim Guerreiro (Brazil) as Rapporteur, John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) as Chair of SBI and Harald Dovland (Norway) as Chair of SBSTA

 During SBI discussions, the G-77/CHINA proposed holding COP-6 in November 2000, while the US, with CANADA, AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND, preferred early 2001

 Regarding the draft guidance for reporting on global climate observation systems, the EU, with MONGOLIA, recommended that Annex I Parties prepare a separate report and include in their national communications a summary based on general reporting requirements

 A joint SBI-SBSTA contact group chaired by Jim Penman (UK) and Mark Mwandosya (Tanzania) was established to consider Part II of the guidelines

1) after CHINA amended the text to state that the purpose of the technical review is to assist “Annex I Parties” instead of “all Parties” in gaining experience relevant to the preparation of guidelines related to Protocol Articles 5 (methodology), 7 (communication) and 8 (review of information)

 A contact group, chaired by Mohamed Mahmoud Ould el Ghaouth (Mauritania), met several times from 26 October - 1 November

 The EU, opposed by CHINA, said the Global Environment Facility (GEF) had provided most non-Annex I Parties with funding for national communications

 IRAN noted that countries have needs determined by their unique circumstances

<p class="MsoNormal">On the timing of second national communications, the G-77/ CHINA noted that there is a differentiated timetable under the FCCC for submission of national communications by Annex I and non-Annex I Parties

 INDIA and CHINA proposed deletion of a paragraph that calls on the CGE to consider steps taken or envisaged by the Party to implement the FCCC

<p class="MsoNormal">In discussing the G-77/China proposal, delegates highlighted, inter alia: the inclusion of EITs in capacity-building activities (EU, KAZAKHSTAN); that capacity building be “for,” “by” and “in” developing countries (the PHILIPPINES); the need for a coordinated response among existing efforts in capacity building (CANADA); the lack of utility in holding short workshops, as developing countries need continuous ones (CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC); and the identification of non-Annex I Parties’ needs by analyzing their national communications (EU)

 AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN and UZBEKISTAN said that capacity building was necessary to take full advantage of the CDM

 AUSTRALIA, the US and the EU highlighted the potential role of the CDM in technology transfer

 The PHILIPPINES called for information on technology transfer activities in Annex I communications

 ARGENTINA and others called for attention to the medical use of HFCs in metered dose inhalers

<p class="MsoNormal">Following informal consultations conducted by Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia), COP-5 adopted a decision on the relationship between efforts to protect the stratospheric ozone layer and efforts to safeguard the global climate system on Thursday, 4 November

<p class="MsoNormal">Chair Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia) reported on a workshop on implementation of FCCC Articles 4

 SENEGAL called for evaluation of vulnerability in Africa by COP-6

 JAPAN and the MARSHALL ISLANDS said consideration of compensation was unacceptable, since it is not provided for in the FCCC or the Protocol

 A contact group co-chaired by Bo Kjéllen (Sweden) and Mohammad Reza Salamat (Iran) was convened on this issue

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY (AIJ):</i> Delegates discussed issues related to AIJ under the pilot phase, first in a joint SBI/SBSTA session and later in five sessions of a joint SBSTA/SBI contact group chaired by Yvo de Boer (Netherlands)

 With POLAND, he stressed that an AIJ project should be eligible under JI or the CDM if it meets the criteria for eligibility and if the Parties involved agree to do so

 The EU and SWITZERLAND, opposed by AOSIS, BOTSWANA and IRAN, proposed that AIJ be credited retroactively

 IRAN noted the absence of criteria for assessing and elaborating the benefits of AIJ projects and said these were subject to different interpretations

 Following subsequent informal consultations conducted by Susan Barrell (Australia), and SBSTA consideration, the COP adopted a draft decision (FCCC/CP/1999/L

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Proposal by Brazil: </i>On Wednesday, 27 October, SBSTA considered the scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal from Brazil, which attempts to allocate responsibilities among different GHG emitters based on their actions as measured by the increase in global temperatures, rather than by emissions

 The EU and PERU, opposed by MALAYSIA, said the issue should be considered as part of IPCC’s TAR

 The conclusions state that SBSTA, inter alia, takes note of a revised version of the proposal by Brazil and decides to consider any new information on this issue at subsequent sessions, as appropriate

 The decision emerged following discussions in SBSTA and extensive informal consultations conducted over several days by José Romero (Switzerland)

<p class="MsoNormal">COP-5 considered proposals to amend FCCC Annex I and II relating to Turkey and Kazakhstan

 Delegates to COP-5 first considered the proposal by Pakistan and Azerbaijan to delete the name of Turkey from Annexes I and II of the FCCC in Plenary on Wednesday, 27 October

 The US, MEXICO and GEORGIA supported the proposal

<p class="MsoNormal">Delegates also considered a proposal from Kazakhstan to be included in the list in FCCC Annex I

 CANADA said the decision-making framework should be based on consistency between the provisions of the Protocol

<p class="MsoNormal">A contact group, co-chaired by Halldor Thorgeirsson (Iceland) and Philip Gwage (Uganda), was convened to consider LULUCF-related issues

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>MECHANISMS:</i> Delegates discussed issues related to the Protocol mechanisms initially in a joint SBI/SBSTA session and later in a contact group chaired by Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia), which met six times

 SOUTH AFRICA, the SUDAN, BOLIVIA, MEXICO and MAURITANIA proposed including in the CDM the concept of emissions avoidance

 JAPAN asked whether unilaterally-funded projects were consistent with the concept of CDM

 COLOMBIA said that as long as CDM projects demonstrate additionality and lead to real and measurable long-term reductions, there should be flexibility in financing the projects

<p class="MsoNormal">On CDM project monitoring, MAURITANIA said monitoring and reporting should not burden the host country

 BOLIVIA suggested that Parties monitor their own projects and “learn by doing

” NORWAY and AUSTRALIA said that project participants, the host Party or a designated legal entity should monitor

 JAPAN responded that each Party should decide on its own and added that creating unnecessary bureaucracies would discourage Annex I Parties from entering into JI

 CANADA, with the US, noted that the review of additionality for JI projects would be under Article 8 (review of information)

 SWITZERLAND suggested a “post-verification model” wherein emission reduction units could not be transferred until they have been certified to be excess Assigned Amount Units (AAUs)

 FRANCE said while trading in CERs is safe, trading in AAUs could be unsafe if the country transferring them ran into compliance trouble at the end of its budget period

 CANADA said it was open to the notion of a core set of guidelines for the creation of national registries, noting that one central registry could be problematic

 Espen Rønneberg (Marshall Islands), Co-Chair of the Joint Working Group on compliance (JWG) with Harald Dovland (Norway), reported on the informal exchange of views on compliance held in Vienna from 6-7 October 1999

 In presenting its preliminary views, JAPAN proposed a single compliance body and outlined steps ranging from technical/financial assistance to a series of recommendations such as strengthening of reporting requirements

 AUSTRALIA said its compliance procedure focused on Protocol Article 3

 A number of developing countries, opposed by NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the US, said the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities should apply

 JAPAN and SWITZERLAND proposed a single body exercising its facilitative and enforcement functions in a graduated manner

 CANADA said the reports would be the factual basis that determined the need for further steps

 CHINA, with IRAN, KUWAIT, BRAZIL and ARGENTINA, said it was inappropriate to give ERTs, a simple fact finding body, a triggering role

<p class="MsoNormal">On the role of the COP/MOP, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and CHINA, opposed by SOUTH AFRICA, proposed that it have a triggering role as well as the competence to decide on the findings of the compliance body

 SWITZERLAND suggested that the COP/MOP, among others, have a triggering role on the basis of Protocol Article 8

<p class="MsoNormal">On sources of information, SAMOA suggested any source the compliance body deemed appropriate, while IRAN said Parties should be the only source

 The EU, with BRAZIL, stressed the need to ensure confidentiality of information submitted in confidence by Parties

 AUSTRALIA and the US said the defending party should be able to rebut evidence against it

 POLAND said there should be an equal number of Protocol Annex B and non-Annex B Parties, and AUSTRALIA, supported by the US, added that the composition would depend on the article under review

 Discussions focused on the level of ambition of the JWG, in particular whether it should “complete its work” at COP-6, as proposed by the EU, the US and others, or “make substantial progress” at COP-6, as supported by SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, UAE and others

 IRAN requested SAUDI ARABIA to join the consensus regarding the level of ambition of the JWG

 ICELAND said single projects, such as a large industrial plant, have a greater proportional impact on emissions in smaller countries, affecting their ability to meet emissions targets

<p class="MsoNormal">On Thursday, 4 November, COP-5 endorsed SBSTA conclusions resulting from informal consultations conducted by Ole Plougmann (Denmark) on the impact of single projects on emissions in the commitment period (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L

<p class="MsoNormal">Regarding guidelines for national systems, the EU, with JAPAN, said they should be flexible in order to reflect differing national circumstances

 AUSTRALIA proposed including, inter alia, quality assurance and quality control procedures, links between national systems and emissions trading systems, and links with the transfer and acquisition of AAUs

<p class="MsoNormal">Regarding adjustments, CANADA noted the lack of clarity in what an adjustment would be

 AUSTRALIA said adjustments are intended as an element of the Protocol’s compliance system

 The EU and JAPAN stated that further discussion on technical aspects should only occur after the completion of the IPCC’s work on good practice

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>SBSTA: </i>SBSTA-11, chaired by Harald Dovland (Norway), held 14 meetings between Monday, 25 October, and Wednesday, 3 November, including three joint SBI/SBSTA sessions

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>“Best Practices” in Policies and Measures: </i>On Wednesday, 27 October, SBSTA Chair Dovland (Norway) announced that Denmark will host a workshop in April 2000 on “best practices” in policies and measures

 AUSTRALIA preferred reference to “good” rather than “best” practices and, with JAPAN and the US, said policies and measures should reflect national circumstances

 In these conclusions, SBSTA, inter alia: accepts the offer of Denmark in collaboration with France to host a workshop to assess best practices in Policies and measures; and decides to consider the report of the workshop at SBSTA-12, and report the results to COP-6

 The US, with POLAND, stressed that timeliness and completeness of submissions were critical in providing a basis for COP action

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Protocol Ratification:</i> Numerous Parties supported the Protocol’s entry into force by Rio+10 in 2002 including, inter alia: BULGARIA, CARICOM, the EU, FRANCE, GERMANY, HAITI, IRELAND, ITALY, JAPAN, SPAIN, SWEDEN, and the UK

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>AIJ: </i>The G-77/CHINA supported the continuation of the pilot phase and, with ZAMBIA, highlighted the imbalance in the geographical distribution of AIJ projects

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Adverse Effects: </i>The G-77/CHINA, NEPAL and others said developing countries are the most affected by climate change, and Annex I countries must implement their commitments relating to provision of financial resources and technology transfer

 ARGENTINA announced its adoption of a voluntary target to reduce its GHG emissions and stated that it does not intend to abandon its status as a non-Annex I Party

 GERMANY urged donor countries to provide the financial means to sustain the operations of the GEF

 With SWITZERLAND and HUNGARY, she emphasized the need for increased domestic action and called for continuation of AIJ and a smooth transition in the future to the CDM and JI

<p class="MsoNormal">MALAYSIA and MEXICO sought consistency in policies between different environmental fora

 BULGARIA called for a meeting to address the specific features of EITs before COP-6

 KUWAIT said this proposal was premature

 ARGENTINA, supported by FINLAND and BENIN, said innovative approaches were needed, and called for the establishment of small task forces in the run-up to COP-6

<p class="MsoNormal">JAPAN, supported by KAZAKHSTAN, BOTSWANA, the US, CANADA, BENIN, ICELAND, HONDURAS and SOUTH AFRICA, suggested that President Szyszko be empowered to appoint a special facilitator to assist negotiations and help Parties realize the BAPA by COP-6

 AUSTRALIA proposed establishing a Committee of the Whole (COW), chaired by a facilitator vested with the authority by President Szyszko

 On progress made in climate change negotiations, PALAU said it was disappointed at the lack of progress being made at COP-5

 KAZAKHSTAN and SYRIA thanked the host country for its hospitality

 At another side event, the University of Wageningen (Netherlands) presented a powerful tool to allow Parties to assess the likely impact on the Kyoto targets if potential new sinks are allowed

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>13TH SESSION OF THE FCCC SUBSIDIARY BODIES:</i> SB-13 will be held in Bonn, Germany, from 11-15 September 2000, preceded by one week of informal meetings, including workshops

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>6TH CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE FCCC:</i> COP-6 will be held in The Hague, the Netherlands, from 13-24 November 2000

<p>The Workshop on Compliance under the Kyoto Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) was held from 1-3 March 2000 at the Wissenschaftszentrum, Bonn, Germany

 He informed participants that the Co-Chairs, in pursuance of their mandate from COP-5 to consult widely, had convened an informal consultation in Montreux, Switzerland, from 9-11 February 2000

 CHINA queried if the ERTs could trigger cases of non-compliance

<p>Introducing her submission on the linkages between Article 8 and adjustments under Article 5, JAPAN highlighted the three stages of the inventory review process: initial check by the Secretariat; synthesis and assessment of inventories; and review by ERTs

<p>Following a question by BRAZIL on the compatibility of such a deduction with the objective of "making the atmosphere whole," she said this deduction, although necessary, would not be a sufficient incentive for ensuring compliance during the budget period

<p>DISCUSSION: AUSTRIA suggested that the Compliance Workshop identify common ground on the linkages between the compliance system and Articles 5, 7 and 8 and present it to the workshop on Articles 5, 7 and 8

 The UK and AUSTRALIA said that the identification of mandatory requirements under Articles 5, 7 and 8 should be left to the groups dealing with the mechanisms and Articles 5, 7 and 8

 NEW ZEALAND, with AUSTRALIA, CANADA, the US and JAPAN, stressed that Parties had a right to use the mechanisms until a breach had been identified through the review process

 JAPAN also questioned the EU distinction between a facilitative and an enforcement process and said assistance would always be helpful as a first step

 AUSTRALIA said Article 3

<p>On the composition of the compliance body, BRAZIL stressed the need to involve the entire international community

 CHINA asked what would happen to a case that had been referred to the facilitation component but despite exhausting all the assistance that component could offer, the Party was still in non-compliance

 CHINA, with the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES and NEW ZEALAND, said Parties should be the main initiators

 With BRAZIL and the US, she questioned the role of the ERTs in the process of referral since they were concerned only with technical information

 ARGENTINA said non-Annex I Parties should be able to refer a case of non-compliance with Article 3

 AUSTRALIA said ERTs had a technical assessment function and, accordingly, an essential referral function

 She opposed a possible screening role by the COP/MOP and said it was difficult to distinguish between a COP/MOP committee, as suggested by BRAZIL and SAUDI ARABIA, and a COP/MOP-established compliance body

 AUSTRALIA said a staged approach should apply to every issue and that there could be a three-month time limit for the facilitation process relating to eligibility in order to ensure timeliness

 JAPAN highlighted the difference between cases under Article 6

 JAPAN and SAMOA referred to their respective proposals for a compliance system and said that such an appeal would be available

 The US, with JAPAN, stressed the importance of due process in the enforcement procedure

 With AUSTRALIA, he added there should be a wide variety of sources of information that the compliance body could use, as appropriate

 AUSTRALIA, supported by BRAZIL and the UK, said the appeal procedure should be part of the compliance system and that Article 19 only applied to bilateral disputes

 On appeal, JAPAN said the Party concerned could ask the COP/MOP to take a decision on the need to re-examine the outcome of the compliance body

 Following a question by CANADA, she said the COP/ MOP itself could decide that a case needed to be reexamined

 JAPAN drew attention to the fact that although the COP/MOP plays a role as a general assembly and has a legitimizing function with respect to final decisions of the compliance body, due to the nature of COP/MOP it is practically difficult for it to consider all the relevant issues

 CANADA opposed the suggestion that the COP/MOP be entitled to ask the compliance body to re-examine a matter

 JAPAN said facilitative consequences would also apply to compliance issues related to the mechanisms and that there should be a staged approach in the case of non-compliance with Article 3

 JAPAN said the policies and measures that could be recommended by the compliance body would depend on the future work of the SBI and SBSTA on policies and measures, in particular in relation to best practices

 CANADA made a distinction between automaticity and predetermination of consequences

 Supported by AUSTRALIA, he opposed the loss of access to mechanisms as a result of a failure to meet the obligations under Article 3

 INDIA cautioned against the use of terms that are not contained in the Protocol, such as "AAUs," and said the JWG should not prejudge the outcome of the work undertaken by the contact group on mechanisms

 JAPAN questioned the utility of including the precautionary principle since it is a general principle that does not direct concrete action in non-compliance cases

 AUSTRALIA asked how the precautionary principle could assist Parties in achieving compliance

" INDIA, with CHINA, stressed the importance of including the notion of common but differentiated responsibilities in the principles section

 CANADA, with AUSTRALIA and the US, opposed the express inclusion of principles in the elements of a compliance framework as he said, the compliance process should ensure the implementation of the Protocol provisions rather than add new rules and principles

 The US, the EU and AUSTRALIA added that the Protocol principles should be reflected in the design of the compliance system itself

" AUSTRALIA stressed that Article 3

 INDIA said that Parties should adhere to the language in the Protocol and keep in mind work undertaken in other contact groups

9 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) were held from 9-11 and 13-15 March 2000 at the Internationales Kongresszentrum Bundehaus in Bonn, Germany

<p>COP-3: The Third Conference of the Parties (COP-3) was held from 1-11 December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan

<p>COP-4: The Fourth Conference of the Parties (COP-4) was held from 2-13 November 1998 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with over 5,000 participants in attendance

<p>SBI-10 AND SBSTA-10: The subsidiary bodies to the FCCC held their tenth sessions in Bonn, Germany, from 31 May - 11 June 1999, and began the process of fulfilling the BAPA

9 (ADVERSE EFFECTS): Under the guidance of SBSTA Chair Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia) and SBI Vice-Chair Mohammad Reza Salamat (Iran), the workshop on adverse effects was held from 21 - 24 September 1999 in Bonn

<p>SBSTA Chair Harald Dovland (Norway) opened the meeting on 9 March and noted that this workshop was the result of a decision taken at the Fifth Conference of the Parties to the FCCC (COP-5)

 Coping strategies used in Bangladesh relating to cyclones and sea-level rise included early warning systems, safe refuges, public information and cultural acceptance of these measures

 He said lessons learned from recent flooding in Mozambique should be used to advance adaptation strategies

 ZIMBABWE noted the need to identify different levels of initial actions appropriate for countries with different levels of development

 Feenstra, Manager of the Netherlands Climate Change Studies Assistance Programme of the Institute for Environmental Studies, made a presentation on the adverse effects of climate change on economic activities

 ZIMBABWE noted that communications and dialogue between policy makers and scientists needed to be two-directional

 UGANDA endorsed the need for awareness raising

<p>Replying to a question from FINLAND relating to the fact that some methodological guidelines for adaptation assessments are now over a decade old, Feenstra said methodologies should continue to be developed, but that this should not be used as a reason to delay adaptation assessments

 Responding to a question from the PHILIPPINES concerning the role of the private sector in adaptation studies, Feenstra noted that the private sector can play a part, but much work is needed to raise its understanding and awareness of climate change

<p>During the ensuing discussion, INDIA questioned the applicability of legislative measures to control abstraction from rivers in cases where water volumes fluctuate widely

 SWITZERLAND noted that precipitation in central Europe in winter has increased by 40%, with more intense rainfall rather than more days of precipitation, which has resulted in flooding

 ZIMBABWE noted the need for regional down-scaling of models to aid in assessing vulnerability and adaptation options

 FINLAND said high resolution climate models are not yet well developed

 Responding to a question from NIGERIA, Jallow underscored that, while climate change is not the only factor negatively affecting water resources, it will exacerbate existing problems

 The NETHERLANDS supported awareness-raising both among the public and policy makers

 Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo (Nigeria), co-chair of the workshop session, stated that "health is wealth," and noted the correlation between health spending and health indicators

 MAURITIUS called for identification of common issues relating to vulnerability and adaptation contained in SIDS’ national communications that could be used in developing adaptation strategies

 Responding to JAMAICA regarding the appropriate level at which to approach adaptation, Kumar said regional cooperation is useful, as specific measures that can be modified at a low cost could be identified and replicated elsewhere

 NIGERIA and ZIMBABWE expressed concern about an approach that might divide the needs of LDCs and other developing countries, and supported considering the needs of all developing countries together

<p>Hiro Kazuno, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan, presented examples of Australia, Japan and the US supporting adaptation measures

 Bo Kjellen (Sweden), co-chair of this session, noted that integration can help avoid creating another layer of bureaucracy specific to climate change

 The PHILIPPINES cautioned against reclassifying projects without prior climate change vulnerability assessment and agreed processes

 NIGERIA said reclassification would create problems for assessment

 FRANCE supported revisiting existing projects and programmes, and asked whether a further step could be taken in the progress, suggesting regional or sectoral workshops on revisiting

 The panel consisted of delegates representing Bangladesh, Jamaica, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Uganda, and the European Commission

<p>Panel presentations: BANGLADESH noted the adverse effects from climate change affecting his country, including flooding, impacts on agricultural production, malnutrition, and the risk of higher incidences of some diseases

<p>The NETHERLANDS noted some participants’ view that it is important for all developing countries, including LDCs, to be producing their national communications, as the vulnerability assessment and adaptation sections will be of value to all developing countries in identifying adaptation options

 NIGERIA expressed reservations about creating centers that could be mono-sectoral in scope, and said regional centers that addressed a number of related areas would be preferable

 In response to the comments on regional centers, JAMAICA stressed that the aim was not to create new institutions but to establish this initiative within existing institutions

 INDIA noted that, although the transfer of technology was an important tool in efforts to address climate change, the lessons and solutions to be found in traditional knowledge systems should not be overlooked

 CANADA urged identification of priorities for action as well as continuation of information-gathering, noting that "action and learning are two sides of the same coin and we have to keep moving on both

<p>On insurance, JAMAICA said governments will have to play a lead role and should have insurance coverage in order to attract inward investment

 QATAR noted the need for more information on adverse effects to clear up some of the existing uncertainties

 MAURITIUS stressed the urgency of acting on Article 4

 BRAZIL observed that, although information gaps need to be filled, vulnerability and adaptation assessment are not mandatory in non-Annex I communications, meaning that national communications will not necessarily be the appropriate means to fill this gap

<p>SBSTA Chair Harald Dovland (Norway) opened the meeting on 13 March and noted that this workshop was the result of a decision at the Fifth Conference of the Parties to the FCCC (COP-5)

 He said China and India would benefit from response measures, and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Annex B (developed country Party) trade may provide limited welfare gains to developing countries

 SWEDEN underscored the importance of factoring in renewable energy sources in modeling

 CANADA questioned whether existing models fully capture the evolution of new, less carbon-intensive technologies

 In response to a question from BOLIVIA, Rutherford said Annex B countries may place restrictions on imports of energy-intensive products from non-Annex B countries

 AUSTRALIA suggested that losses in potential oil revenue could result in growth prospects in other areas that could compensate for any hypothetical loss predicted under these models

<p>In the ensuing discussion, SAUDI ARABIA and NIGERIA cautioned that energy intensive industry may not necessarily relocate to oil exporting countries

 NIGERIA stated that consumer and ethical values may create trade barriers between high and low energy intensive countries

<p>In the ensuing discussion, AUSTRALIA expressed doubt that a reconstruction effort of current climate change models was necessary

 In response to a question from BOLIVIA on the CDM, Banuri said it could provide incentives for investment in developing countries, but that much work remained to ensure that it contributed to sustainable development

 JAPAN noted that compensation is not mentioned in the FCCC and the Kyoto Protocol

<p>Philip Gwage, Assistant Commissioner, Applied Meteorology and Data Processing, Ministry of Land, Water and Environment of Uganda, considered the impacts of response measures on LDCs

 The NETHERLANDS said he understood that the impact of response measures on non-annex I energy importers would be positive or neutral overall

 JAPAN observed that oil prices have been rising regardless of FCCC-related measures

 Bo Kjellen (Sweden), who chaired this session, noted that commodity prices have a history of price fluctuations

 IRAN said renewable energy sources have only a limited capacity to compensate for conventional sources

 FRANCE called for more work on the transportation sector, as it is critical in terms of energy use

 The panel consisted of delegates representing Bolivia, Canada, Japan, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and the UK

<p>Panel presentations: BOLIVIA underscored the need for progressing sustainable development within the FCCC framework

 He indicated his willingness to consider Iran’s list of proposals for action, but said Japan cannot accept the idea of compensation

<p>Discussion: In the ensuing discussion, the PHILIPPINES said the burden of proof in terms of documentation of impacts is shifting from Annex I to non-Annex I countries

 IRAN commented that the workshop had focused too much on the recent oil price rise, noting that this is not a permanent phenomenon

 Mohammed Reza Salamat (Iran), who chaired this session, agreed that the current rise cannot be a major factor when detecting impacts of response measures, while the UK underscored the difficulty of trying to assess the impacts against severe market fluctuations

<p>On modeling, PORTUGAL noted that models are an indicative tool, but cannot prove anything

 Noting the importance of biomass for many LDCs, AUSTRALIA said models need to take into account all GHGs and sinks

 The PHILIPPINES and ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA called for additional refinement of economic analysis, including other analytical tools besides modeling

 The NETHERLANDS noted the need for national communications from more non-Annex I countries, and disagreed with the concept of a fund for compensation

 CANADA said it would be useful to focus on maximizing the benefits of response measures, particularly in relation to the world’s two billion poor

 In response, the UK and CANADA noted their liberalization of energy markets and renewable energy measures

<p>Mohammad Reza Salamat (Iran), who co-chaired the closing plenary, noted participants’ comments on difference in the situations of various developing countries, and on identifying those developing countries dependent on fossil fuels, either as producers or consumers

 Bo Kjellen (Sweden), who had chaired earlier workshop sessions, underscored several participants’ comments on the need for close cooperation between the climate convention and other conventions, particularly the desertification convention

 CANADA and the UK said modeling should address net rather than gross impacts

 JAPAN said the report should reflect the fact that some issues were raised but may not have been discussed in-depth or agreed on

<p>The twelfth sessions of the subsidiary bodies (SB-12) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) will take place from 12-16 June 2000 in Bonn, Germany, preceded by one week of informal meetings scheduled for 5-10 June

 The Sixth Conference of the Parties (COP-6), scheduled to take place from 13-24 November 2000, in The Hague, the Netherlands, will mark the culmination of this two-year process

9 were held from 9-11 and 13-15 March 2000 in Bonn, Germany

<p> WORKSHOP ON ISSUES RELATED TO ARTICLES 5, 7 &amp; 8 OF THE KYOTO PROTOCOL: The workshop on issues related to Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information) took place from 14-16 March 2000, in Bonn, Germany

<p> WORKSHOP ON BEST PRACTICES IN POLICIES AND MEASURES: The Workshop on Best Practices in Policies and Measures (P&amp;Ms) under the FCCC was held from 11-13 April 2000 in Copenhagen, Denmark

 The meeting was co-sponsored by Denmark and France and organized by the FCCC Secretariat in cooperation with the SBSTA Chair

<p> EFIEA CLIMATE POLICY WORKSHOP "FROM KYOTO TO THE HAGUE - EUROPEAN PERSPECTIVES ON MAKING THE KYOTO PROTOCOL WORK": The Second European Forum for International Environmental Assessment (EFIEA) Climate Workshop, "From Kyoto to the Hague - European Perspectives on Making the Kyoto Protocol Work," took place from 18-19 April 2000, at the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences in Amsterdam

<p>Delegates discussed issues related to the Protocol mechanisms in workshops during the pre-sessional week, a Joint SBI/SBSTA session and in a contact group during SB-12 chaired by Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia)

<p>Bolivia, Colombia, the US, Iran, Honduras, Chile and Norway supported the inclusion of sinks projects in the CDM

 IRAN said that in light of the FCCC’s comprehensive approach, the CDM should cover all six gases, and all sources and sinks

 The EU and Switzerland opposed sinks projects in the CDM, as it raised questions of methodological uncertainty, non-permanence and leakage

 The Sudan and Senegal said it was premature to decide on the inclusion of sinks, as the IPCC Special Report on LULUCF had just been released

<p>AOSIS, with Colombia, said Protocol Article 6 (Joint Implementation) and 12 (CDM) should be given equal treatment in the context of share of proceeds for adaptation, as this would ensure real additional funds for adaptation, sufficient funds for administrative costs, and no additional transaction costs for the CDM

<p>At the joint SBI/SBSTA meeting on Friday, 16 June, SBI Chair Ashe introduced a document containing a recommendation of the subsidiary bodies for a draft resolution to be adopted at COP-6 that expresses solidarity with southern African countries, particularly Mozambique, following the devastation caused by Cyclone Eline

 Mozambique thanked delegates for their expression of support

<p>The draft resolution expresses solidarity with the people and governments of southern Africa, in particular Mozambique; invites the international community to lend immediate assistance; and urges all governments, UN agencies, intergovernmental organizations, NGOs, the private sector and the wider community to continue to seek permanent solutions to climate change, including bringing the Protocol into force as soon as possible

 The text also invites support for reconstruction efforts in Mozambique and other southern African States and urges Parties to increase technical and financial assistance to the countries affected

 Uruguay noted the complexity of this process, but was encouraged by progress at SB-12

 India cautioned against fragmenting the process unnecessarily and dividing into too many sub-bodies and processes

<p>The number of difficult issues currently on the table leaves scope for several package-deals within the JWG between the EU, the G-77/ China and other delegations

 To date, most African countries, India and China appear to be non-committal, and are observing how the issue unfolds before deciding on their game plans

 These positions will become more apparent during the upcoming workshop in Poland as well as in the 1 August submissions, both of which will set the stage for Lyon and pose a key test for the environmental integrity of the Kyoto Protocol

 In achieving agreement on text that will form the basis of negotiations at SB-13, the contact group Co-Chairs charted a difficult line between the positions taken by the G-77/China, the EU and the Umbrella Group, an informal alliance of like-minded developed countries, including Australia, Canada, Japan and the US

<p>However, this should not deflect attention from their interests as well as their behind-the-scenes bilateral discussions with developing countries, such as Argentina, China, Colombia and India, with respect to climate change politics

 Doubts that had been expressed earlier over Nigeria’s chairmanship of the G-77/ China, given its membership in OPEC, fell away as the group’s issue coordinators appeared to have sufficient flexibility to develop and represent the broader G-77/China perspectives, such as in LULUCF

<p>informal consultations on mechanisms from 6-8 July, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia;</p> 

<p>a workshop on LULUCF from 10-15 July, in Poznan, Poland;</p>

<p align="justify"><font size="3">On the definition of "forest," TUVALU supported the biome approach, and said it should be elaborated by COP-7

 The EU, the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, NORWAY and CHILE agreed, but said the approach is not yet mature and the definition in the Co-Chairs’ text will suffice for the time being

 The EU stressed the need for consistency and symmetry within all definitions, while CHINA said it would be premature to agree on definitions relevant to Protocol Article 3

" BRAZIL and PERU said natural regeneration is a management approach according to the IPCC Special Report, and is not always human-induced

3, the EU, US, PERU and TUVALU called for symmetry in terms of credits for afforestation and reforestation on one hand and debits for deforestation on the other

 Opposed by NEW ZEALAND and supported by INDIA, he added that, pending agreement of this issue in the LULUCF group, any reference to Article 3

 Co-Chair Newton Paciornik (Brazil) said the Co-Chairs would consult on this issue with the Co-Chairs of the contact group on LULUCF

 INDIA explained that AA are fixed amounts and therefore cannot be reviewed, however the information on additions and subtractions would be reviewed

 BRAZIL, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, then introduced a text for a new Part III <i>bis</i> that addresses the terminology "initial AA" and replaces it with "amounts that contribute to the compliance of a Party included in Annex I with the quantified emission limitation and reduction commitment under Article 3

<p align="justify"><font size="3">The US and AUSTRALIA proposed deleting text requesting the Secretariat to compile information on P&amp;Ms implemented and planned by Annex I Parties, noting the significant resource implications for the Secretariat

 The G-77/ CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, SAMOA and BRAZIL proposed retaining the request, and urged specific reference to the Protocol

 AUSTRALIA and the US, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA and SAMOA, said the information to be compiled by the Secretariat should be based exclusively on information supplied in the national communications

 CHINA underlined that there remains disagreement on the issue of unilateral or bilateral projects, and on the possible limited inclusion of sinks in the CDM

 Opposed by BRAZIL, he called on Parties not to push for the most comprehensive and complex regime, but one that will be "viable

 CANADA said legally-binding consequences were also justified on competitiveness grounds

 Supporting AUSTRALIA, JAPAN explained that its main trading partners were not the other Annex I Parties but non-Annex I Asian countries

 CANADA supported the voluntary payments to a compliance fund to deal with mitigation projects

 IRAN said such a fund should also minimize the adverse impact of response measures

<p align="justify">The Sixteenth Sessions of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies (SB-16) opened on Wednesday, 5 June, in Bonn, Germany

 VENEZUELA, for the G-77/CHINA, said that the recent focus on the Protocol has meant that some UNFCCC issues have been neglected, particularly those relevant to developing countries

<p align="justify">On a proposal by Canada on cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy, the G-77/CHINA said the item was incorrectly worded on the provisional agenda, and it should refer to the report of the workshop on this issue, not to a proposal

 CANADA said the provisional agenda correctly referred to a proposal and, supported by several Annex I Parties and UZBEKISTAN, but opposed by SAUDI ARABIA and the G-77/CHINA, stressed retaining the issue as worded in the provisional agenda

 Chair Thorgeirsson said a contact group would be convened on the issue, co-chaired by David Warrilow (UK) and Rawleston Moore (Barbados)

 A contact group, chaired by Audun Rosland (Norway) and Newton Paciornik (Brazil) will meet to consider these issues

 KENYA, for the G-77/CHINA, said the geographic distribution of projects should be improved, particularly for Africa

 UGANDA said unfair distribution could impact on Africa’s level of project experience, and thus its ability to participate in the CDM

 CHINA said any modification to the uniform reporting format should not affect decisions already taken on AIJ, particularly those relating to funding and technology transfer

<p align="justify">Yet in spite of the quiet atmosphere anticipated in Bonn, the meeting was not without tension on its opening day, with many participants discussing the discord over two proposals raised by Canada and Saudi Arabia

 The Canadian proposal is controversial because some observers see it as an attempt for Canada to gain further flexibility under the Protocol from its energy exports

 With UGANDA and NORWAY, he supported basing definitions on those agreed for Protocol Article 3

 JAPAN stressed consideration of host country conditions

 UGANDA, with NORWAY, stressed including agroforestry

 BURKINA FASO and MOROCCO said all countries should be eligible for participation

 CANADA, with MALAYSIA and AUSTRALIA, advocated discussing climate change research in addition to systematic observation

 TUVALU, supported by the G-77/CHINA and opposed by NEW ZEALAND and CANADA, proposed including development of modalities for the application of the Principles

 CANADA stressed his understanding that COP-7 decided that CDM projects generate CERs (certified emissions reductions), not RMUs (removal units)

 On modalities, MALAYSIA underscored the need to understand the issues before proceeding to drafting

 Regarding the next workshop, CHINA said it should focus on exchange of views, not negotiation

 MALAYSIA said agreement cannot be guaranteed at COP-9

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Julia Martínez Fernández, Ministry for the Environment, Mexico, briefed participants on her country’s mitigation policies and activities

 Noting the environmental, economic and health benefits of mitigation projects, she observed that Mexico has now decoupled emissions growth from economic growth

 Responding to a question from Iran about the drop in energy intensity in Mexico in the late 1990s, Martínez said this was because of a devaluation of the Peso in 1995

 Barbados raised concerns that the revised UNFCCC Guidelines increased the information requirements, expertise and resources needed to prepare the second national communication, as compared to the first communication

 Thailand informed participants of a proposal to include information on technology needs assessments on the TT:Clear website, which is an information clearing house on technology transfer issues

 Kenya agreed, noting that her country’s efforts in this area had been hampered by a lack of funding

 Answering a question from Nigeria on whether the US$405,000 was the minimum or maximum amount countries could apply for, Bonduki said it was the maximum using the expedited process, but countries could choose to apply for a full-sized GEF project instead, in which case the amount could be higher

 Barbados reiterated the choice that countries face between using the expedited process for funding their second national communications, or using the regular GEF project cycle

 Burkina Faso expressed concerns that the US$405,000 allocated for second communications using the expedited process should be a flexible rather than a fixed amount, and Nigeria questioned whether this level of funding would be adequate for every country

 A report on the workshop will be prepared by the Secretariat for consideration by SBSTA-21, meeting in conjunction with the tenth Conference of the Parties (COP-10) in December 2004, in Buenos Aires, Argentina

 Following intense negotiations that concluded at COP-3 in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, delegates agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed countries and countries with economies in transition (EITs) to achieve quantified emissions reduction targets

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana"> <font size="2">WORKSHOP BACKGROUND: </font> <font size="2">At SBSTA-19, meeting in conjunction with COP-9, in December 2003, in Milan, Italy, Parties examined data showing that, while the aggregate 2000 greenhouse gas emissions of Annex I Parties were below 1990 levels, these emissions are expected to increase in the period 2000-2010

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Halldór Thorgeirsson, Coordinator of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), UNFCCC Secretariat, welcomed participants and read a statement on behalf of SBSTA Chair Abdullatif Benrageb (Libya), who was unable to be present at the workshop and, therefore, requested Hans-Joachim Ziesing (Germany), Micheal Young (Ireland) and Neil Ferry (Australia) to facilitate the workshop on his behalf

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana"> <font size="2"> PRESENTATIONS ON NATIONAL EXPERIENCES: </font> <font size="2">Francis Bossier, Federal Planning Bureau, Belgium, described the methodology used to develop emissions projections in his country’s third national communication, which includes a combination of models for projections to 2010 and 2020, taking into account scenarios “with measures” and “with additional measures,” such as the introduction of a carbon dioxide tax and the effects of non-fiscal measures

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Takaaki Ito, Ministry of Environment, Japan, said the national Guideline for Measures to Prevent Global Warming, adopted in March 2002, is being updated

 He described methods used by Japan to project emissions of different sectors

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Andrea Edelmann, Environment Agency, Austria, presented on the Austrian experience with emissions projections, emphasizing two main challenges: institutional arrangements and methodological issues

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stane Merše, Energy Efficiency Center, Slovenia, presented on the methods and challenges in Slovenian emissions projections

 He said Slovenia faces a challenging task in meeting its emissions reduction commitments, but pointed to awareness raised by the European Union (EU) Emission Trading Scheme, which is leading to better greenhouse gas inventories

 Responding to a question from China on the source of this information, Merše said Slovenia is carrying out energy audits, and that precise data on some energy technologies is available for bigger companies

 He said the bottom-up technology-oriented approach used by Slovenia involves data uncertainty, but ensures better process knowledge

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anne Kristin Fosli, Ministry of Finance, Norway, spoke on facts and experiences regarding emissions projections in her country

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stefan Vögele, Systems Analysis and Technology Evaluation, Germany, presented on the IKARUS model used by Germany in developing emissions projections and estimating impacts of present and future policy measures

 Slovenia emphasized the importance of diverse modeling approaches, but said ideas and knowledge could be exchanged to get better results

 Norway suggested that a model could be developed for use by the UNFCCC to generate comparable data for Parties and for comparison with the results arrived at by countries using different modeling techniques

 He said Australia employs multiple models for key sectors, including a combination of bottom-up and top-down models

 Ferry said that Australia does “with measures” but not “with additional measures” scenarios

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Highlighting the different results, Germany asked how the “correct” projection is assessed

 China asked whether the driving forces in different models are compared, and Ferry said this is now being done

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Erik Rasmussen, Environmental Protection Agency, Denmark, outlined his country’s experience with emissions projections

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Christo Christov, Energy Institute, Bulgaria, presented the challenges faced by Bulgaria in projecting emissions

 Argentina questioned the meaning of “without measures” scenarios, and suggested that if “with measures” scenarios are business as usual, then “with additional measures” represents a mitigation scenario

 Ireland suggested that non-environmental policies should also be included, pointing to agricultural policies that also reduce greenhouse gas emissions as an example

 Denmark highlighted the distinction between policies and measures, suggesting that only implemented measures should be considered in scenarios

 On the latter, Germany said that this would depend on the definitions of different scenarios, while Argentina said that different scenarios are not comparable and therefore the costs and impacts are not comparable

 China said that the introduction of cost considerations would further complicate the models and questioned how this could contribute to the UNFCCC process

 Ireland underlined that, while models showing different results are a cause for concern, models that show the same result are not necessarily compatible

 Agreeing with Ireland, the Czech Republic pointed out that countries have invested considerable time and effort in developing different models, and should not be asked to change them

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On possible means to facilitate the comparability of national greenhouse gas projections, Germany proposed to recommend a small and robust set of general key assumptions such as world energy prices, population and GDP

 Belgium said that GDP was a result of other considerations in his country’s model, while the EC noted that it did not matter whether GDP was an input or output of the model as long as its origin was clear

 China suggested providing more detail, such as information on key assumptions by sector

 Austria commented on the convenience of using older finalized data instead of the latest inventory “unfinished” data

 China suggested the publication of a book explaining the projections, in order to provide background on the modeling approaches and key assumptions

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana"> <font size="2"> PRESENTATIONS ON NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES: </font> <font size="2">Francis Altdorfer, ECONOTEC, Belgium, presented an energy demand model using the Emissions Projection Model (EPM), developed by ECONOTEC and used for Belgium’s third national communication

 He said energy demand modeling plays a crucial role in Belgium, given limited flexibility in reducing emissions from energy, the complex relationship between economic activity and emissions levels, and the substantial emissions reduction potential with negative cost

 During the ensuing discussion, China questioned the driving forces in the service sector that are taken into account, and Altdorfer agreed that this presented a challenge given the variety of activities, and requires further work

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kejun Jiang, Energy Research Institute, China, presented on the Integrated Policy Assessment Model for China (IPAC), which includes, <i>inter alia</i>, models for technology, emissions, power generation and transport

 Describing several industrial and transport parameters for China, he said China’s economic target for 2020, which is to quadruple the GDP, is a key driving force

 He noted that future challenges include better understanding of the energy production and consumption sectors in China

 Štreimikiene said Lithuania has projections for all sectors, and noted that total projections indicate that her country will not have difficulties in meeting the Kyoto emissions reduction target

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Janis Rekis, Latvian Investment and Development Agency, presented on experiences with greenhouse gas emissions projections for the energy sector in Latvia

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nilgün Egemen, State Institute of Statistics, Turkey, described the projection exercise carried out for the first national communication to be completed later this year

 She outlined present and projected energy scenarios for Turkey, noting that the energy sector is the biggest producer of carbon dioxide emissions in Turkey

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Replying to a question from Belgium on why a simple method is used to model HFCs, PFCs and sulphur hexafluoride emissions instead of the model used in the projections for ozone depleting substances, Delhotal said the sources are not necessarily similar and that there were difficulties in data collection, as companies are hesitant to divulge proprietary information

 In response to a question from China on whether scenarios “with additional measures” will be projected in the future, she said it is unlikely that they will be considered for the fourth national communication, even if there is a change in administration as a result of the Presidential election later this year, since the time would be too brief

 Germany suggested providing “low” and “high” projections to address this

 Bulgaria observed that overestimations may result from the fact that national communications are a communication by governments to the UNFCCC, not a scientific exercise

 The Netherlands noted that despite political requirements, expert choices are made with respect to the model results

 China suggested that a common approach could be to have bottom-up models

 Germany pointed out that national models could not account for impacts on other countries, for which bi-national or multinational models are required

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On implications of emissions trading and project-based mechanisms on projections, the Netherlands said assumptions about the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and project-based mechanisms are considered in his country’s emissions projections

 China suggested that countries with experience in including trading mechanisms in projections could report on their experiences for the benefit of other countries

 Bulgaria said accounting for trading in projections was a problem for EIT countries, given the lack of information on the willingness of countries to engage in JI projects, and the resulting impact on emissions in EIT countries

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On modeling greenhouse gas-related factors particularly relevant to agriculture, Finland raised the problem of lack of data availability, and suggested improving methodologies for gathering information

 Noting that it is more a matter of good organization than lack of data, the Netherlands said detailed statistics, updated every five years, could significantly improve the quality of inventories

 The EC pointed to bottom-up approaches for assessing<i> </i>P&amp;Ms, and the Netherlands suggested merging both bottom-up and top-down approaches

 Italy proposed improved cooperation between national institutions, possibly through expert groups, to allow more cohesive institutional arrangements

 The Netherlands supported the idea of providing an explanation of the drivers, suggesting that the experts who provide the figures could easily add a simple clarification

 Among the main factors that influence emissions, Denmark proposed area of occupation, number of livestock, fertilizer application and<i> </i>distribution of manure as general examples

 Finland called for more information on historical background and linking past and future trends

 New Zealand and Denmark suggested lack of expertise as a challenge to projections

 The Netherlands said projections can be based on extrapolation, but this results in high uncertainty

 Finland pointed to three challenges: classification of land according to the IPCC categories; difficulties in tracking changes in land use; and assessing the distribution of mineral and organic soils

 Finland suggested that agriculture and LULUCF reporting should be more closely linked

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana"> <font size="2"> INTERNATIONAL MEETING TO REVIEW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAMME OF ACTION FOR SIDS: </font> <font size="2">This issue was taken up by SBSTA on Thursday, 19 May, when Tuvalu, for AOSIS, noted that the UN General Assembly will consider the Mauritius Strategy during its upcoming session, and proposed that SBSTA consider the Strategy at SBSTA 23

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the informal consultations held over the following week, differences emerged over whether there should be a follow-up process on how the UNFCCC could help implement the Mauritius Strategy further, and on what the process might involve

 AOSIS, the EU and the G-77/China sought a process that would invite submissions and address the issue at COP 11, while the US said there was no need for further UNFCCC work on this matter, and preferred shorter text taking note of the Mauritius Strategy

 The US, Canada, India and others objected to EU-proposed text addressing climate change and sea-level rise in the context of the Millennium Review in September 2005

 Delegates also discussed text proposed by the EU that would link the prioritization of energy efficiency and renewable energy under the Mauritius Strategy with the fourteenth and fifteenth sessions of the Commission on Sustainable Development in 2006-2007

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">An attempt at a compromise formulation on the process was proposed on Wednesday, 25 May by Australia, suggesting text inviting Parties to submit “views on further implementation of relevant aspects of the Mauritius Declaration and Strategy through ongoing work of the SBI and SBSTA, as appropriate

” However, Australia subsequently withdrew that proposal and replaced it with another formulation that invited Parties to continue to take into account the issue in the ongoing work of the SBSTA, as appropriate

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the SBSTA plenary on Friday, 27 May, Canada, the US, New Zealand and Japan supported Australia’s second proposal

 However, AOSIS and the EU could not agree to it, with Tuvalu, speaking for AOSIS, suggesting that “certain Parties have no room for flexibility

” Mauritius said he could support the earlier Australian proposal, but not the second

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana"> <font size="2"> GLOBAL CLIMATE OBSERVING SYSTEM:</font> <font size="2"> SBSTA considered this matter briefly on Thursday, 19 May, when Vice-Chair Abdulla said he would draft conclusions on the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and noted concerns voiced by Argentina about territorial water issues and drifting buoys

 Karsten Sach (Germany) agreed to chair a contact group on this agenda item

 Australia, Japan, India, the EU, New Zealand and others supported the IPCC request, while Saudi Arabia and China suggested that the IPCC Report could be taken up at COP 14

 While some Parties, such as Norway and Canada, suggested that some proposals could be implemented immediately, Saudi Arabia urged further discussion

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On COP 11 and COP/MOP 1, the SBI thanks the Government of Canada for offering to host the event, and requests the host country to facilitate the issuance of visas to ensure Parties’ effective participation

 The US proposed reducing the UNFCCC budget by US$2 million, while Japan proposed reducing the overall budget by US$3 million

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the final plenary, Jamaica, for the G-77/China, noted that the group had gone along with the agreement under great duress, and that it was “embarrassed” to be part of a decision that sends the wrong signal to the global community about Parties’ commitment to the climate change process

 Argentina noted that this incentive only affects developing countries because only they request financial help to attend meetings

 In the plenary meeting on Thursday, 26 May, SBI adopted conclusions on this sub-item following minor textual amendments proposed by Australia

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana"> <font size="2"> IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEADQUARTERS AGREEMENT:</font> <font size="2"> This issue was taken up briefly in SBI plenary on Friday, 20 May, when Germany and Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter reported on the Headquarters Agreement and on progress on extending it to cover the Protocol

 Japan and Switzerland added that efforts should be conducted within available resources

 The EU supported Croatia’s proposal for its emissions baselines for 1990, while Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro expressed their reservations

3) on flexibility for Croatia under UNFCCC Article 4

 In the draft decision, the COP confirms that Croatia shall be allowed a certain degree of flexibility with regard to its historical level of greenhouse gas emissions, and decides that SBI will consider the level of emissions for Croatia’s base year at a future session

” Jamaica, speaking for the G-77/China, congratulated delegates on resolving issues such as non-Annex I national communications, but expressed “extreme disappointment” at lack of progress on the SCCF

 Luxembourg, speaking for the EU, said SBI had made good progress

<p align="justify" class="Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the Carbon Expo in Cologne, Germany, held the week prior to SB 22, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Waller-Hunter raised another concern

 Canada is keen on credits, and they are proving hard to come by due to the complexity of the current CDM process

 Indications of nervousness on the part of the US and others were detected in apparent attempts to pre-empt any linkage between recent extreme weather events and climate change, as well as in discussions on the Mauritius Strategy

 According to some, China has stepped up its engagement in the process

 There is little expectation that any agenda item introduced by Canada will go beyond a discussion, for example at the High Level segment, at this stage

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On a proposal by Canada to include a foreword clarifying the scope of the SPM, Co-Chair Metz said that the Co-Chairs would prepare the foreword but that it would not be presented as part of the draft SPM for approval

 SWITZERLAND, with CHINA and DENMARK, requested the Co-Chairs provide an opportunity for delegates to comment on the foreword, while AUSTRALIA proposed an informal discussion on the issue

 Co-Chair Metz said an informal discussion would be welcome if time allowed it and, with KENYA, noted the importance of concentrating on approval of the SPM

 FRANCE stressed the need to clarify the cost of assumptions and time frames for storage

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On referencing emission sources, SWITZERLAND, supported by PAKISTAN, CHILE, NORWAY and others, noted that “anthropogenic sources” was too vague as it could include land use, land use change, and forestry

 Delegates agreed to a proposal by AUSTRALIA and NORWAY to replace “anthropogenic sources” with “industry and energy related sources

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Discussion also focused on whether CCS “is” or “could be” a mitigation option, with FRANCE, SWITZERLAND, GERMANY, ZAMBIA, AUSTRIA, and others saying that it “could be”, while SAUDI ARABIA, AUSTRALIA, and the US supported “is” with some qualifying text

 FRANCE stated that it could not accept that “CCS is a mitigation option” as long as CCS included ocean storage

 CHINA said the paragraph did not provide additional information and it should either be revised or deleted

 SWITZERLAND, supported by KOREA, BELGIUM, and others, noted that referring only to stabilization and not to reduction of greenhouse gas concentrations is prescriptive

 SLOVENIA, supported by GERMANY, proposed a reference to Article 2 of the UNFCCC (ultimate objective)

” SWEDEN proposed inserting a reference to “management” instead of “enhancement” of biological sinks

 SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by SLOVENIA and RUSSIA, was not supportive of the reference in the text to nuclear power as a mitigation option

 BANGLADESH proposed stronger reference to energy efficiency

 SLOVENIA, opposed by the UK, proposed specifying ï¿½anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide

 AUSTRALIA noted the need for the text to show that the range of technical options may be greater than those that could be used legally

 FRANCE and DENMARK highlighted the importance of not excluding the possibility that aquifers and geothermal formations could be used to store carbon dioxide even if they have other uses

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The US, opposed by GERMANY and AUSTRIA, called for removal of the reference to leakage from the transport of carbon dioxide as a factor in the net reduction of emissions through CCS, given the minor impact of leakage

 DENMARK and AUSTRIA asked for more detail on the differences between energy consumption associated with CCS in coal and gas power plants

 AUSTRIA, supported by BELGIUM, suggested noting that the percentages in this section were calculated under the assumption that leakage does not occur, while the UK, with AUSTRIA, proposed mentioning ï¿½secure storageï¿½ instead of ï¿½leakage

ï¿½ DENMARK, opposed by AUSTRALIA, and supported by CHILE and AUSTRIA, called for referencing biomass in this section

 BELGIUM requested inclusion of a reference to the time scale of storage noted elsewhere in the SPM

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On geological storage, BELGIUM, with the UK, called for a specific reference to secure reservoirs

 DENMARK, supported by the UK and the NETHERLANDS, suggested emphasizing caprock as a necessary trapping mechanism

 Delegates also agreed to add a footnote including reference to the dense phase of carbon dioxide at depths below 800 meters, as proposed by the UK with the support of AUSTRIA and the US, and that the footnote should refer to the recovery of methane, as suggested by FRANCE

 A number of countries, including BELGIUM, DENMARK, FRANCE and GERMANY, supported the inclusion of some sort of reference to risks

 Other countries, including JAPAN, KENYA and SAUDI ARABIA, said that a reference to risks in this section was not necessary

 On the section noting that ocean storage can be carried out in two ways, via injection into the water column or via deposits on the sea floor, AUSTRALIA, supported by BELGIUM and CANADA, suggested noting that ocean storage may “potentially” be carried out in two ways

 Although JAPAN and the NETHERLANDS expressed reservations about this, AUSTRALIA’s suggestion was agreed to

 After further comments from CHILE, NEW ZEALAND and GERMANY regarding clarification of the process and time scale of equilibration, delegates agreed to the original version of the draft text, which states that this carbon dioxide would “eventually equilibrate with the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

” BELGIUM proposed, and delegates agreed, to reference the section of the Special Report on environmental impacts, risk, and risk management

 Co-Chair Metz noted work would continue with Japan on clarifying the measurement scale used in a figure providing an overview of ocean storage options

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On industrial uses of carbon dioxide, Co-Chair Davidson noted that the draft text incorporated a proposal by Canada, which was supported by the US, to note that enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is excluded from the statement that the potential for industrial uses of carbon dioxide is small

 GERMANY noted that including such a reference could falsely suggest that EOR is a large opportunity

 Delegates approved a comment previously submitted by Germany to note that there is relatively little experience in combining carbon dioxide capture, transport and storage into a fully integrated CCS system, and that the use of CCS for large scale power plants remains to be implemented

 Several delegates, including GERMANY, AUSTRIA, EGYPT, the UK, and the NETHERLANDS, proposed amendments to text in the table caption that would state that more research and development could reduce costs and improve reliability and safety

 On the table itself, delegates also agreed to changes proposed by GERMANY and others on what is meant by “market maturity,” and by JAPAN and KOREA on the inclusion of reference to the two types of ocean storage: direct injection “dissolution type” and direct injection “lake type

 Delegates agreed to changes proposed by EGYPT and others clarifying that the text refers to major point sources

 KENYA sought clarification of why a particular figure (300km) was being used

 JAPAN underscored that ocean storage potential varies regionally, and that Japan has more potential for ocean than geological storage

 AUSTRIA, AUSTRALIA and others expressed concern that the language implied greater technical maturity and scientific analysis on ocean storage than actually exists

 AUSTRALIA, supported by the UK, said that meeting the depth criteria alone should not be sufficient to establish ocean storage locations

 JAPAN replied that environmental and other considerations are addressed in other SPM sections

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">CHINA, supported by BANGLADESH, EGYPT and SAUDI ARABIA, and opposed by AUSTRIA, called for removing a reference to developing countries as possessing the places where most of the increase in the number of sources is expected to occur

 AUSTRIA called for distinguishing between large and small point sources, and suggested referring to projections in the sentence on future emissions in developing countries

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> CANADA, with the US and NORWAY, proposed including information on storage as well as capture when stating the percentages of global fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions that could be suitable for capture

 CANADA proposed using information from power generating emissions, while the US proposed including emissions from both industry and electricity generation

 MALAYSIA and BELGIUM noted that the Special Report referred to 20 - 40% global fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions as being technically suitable for capture, and proposed deleting reference to economic suitability

 AUSTRIA suggested separating the section of the paragraph on scenario emissions from the section on emissions amenable to capture

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On a figure indicating the geographical relationship between carbon dioxide emission sources and sedimentary basins with geological storage potential, CHINA proposed removing the figure, saying that much of the information was not supported by valid scientific facts, and that it did not include future source emissions

 AUSTRIA, NEW ZEALAND, the US and CANADA supported keeping the figure because it contains relevant information

 CHILE and NEW ZEALAND expressed concern over the US$ 25 - 30 price quoted, given the long lifetime of some projects

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On text noting that low cost capture possibilities can lead to storage of up to 360 Mt CO<sub>2</sub> “cumulatively” under low or absent incentives, AUSTRALIA suggested clarifying that “cumulatively” refers to the lifetime of the projects observed in the underlying study

 CHINA expressed concern that the text did not explain that this number relates to technical, as opposed to economic, storage potential

” GERMANY highlighted that ocean and geological storage potential cannot be directly compared given their different retention times, and JAPAN noted that this difference is addressed elsewhere in the SPM

 CHINA proposed deleting a figure that shows the contribution of CCS as part of a mitigation portfolio, noting that the figure only refers to two scenario studies for stabilization at 550 ppmv CO<sub>2</sub>

 GERMANY, AUSTRIA, and KENYA highlighted the relevance of the figure and supported keeping it

 AUSTRALIA supported retention of the figure, but agreed with CHINA that the text should state that it refers to illustrative examples of the range of scenario studies

 After informal consultations led by AUSTRALIA, delegates agreed to add text noting that analyses in this field are limited and further assessment may be necessary to improve information

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana"> <font size="2">What are the local health, safety and environmental risks of CCS? </font> <font size="2">On local risks associated with carbon dioxide pipeline transport, ZAMBIA sought clarification of a statement that the risks are possibly lower than comparable hydrocarbon pipelines

 JAPAN sought to include text specifying that mortality only occurs near injection points, while CHILE, supported by MALAYSIA and CHINA, said ocean effects could not be inferred from the results of studies in confined environments

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana"> <font size="2">Will physical leakage of stored carbon dioxide compromise CCS as a climate change mitigation option?</font> <font size="2"> FRANCE, with support from others, stressed the need to highlight that leakage from ocean storage could offset some of the benefits of CCS

 The US, with support from JAPAN, CANADA and others, proposed separating wording on geological and ocean storage due to differences in retention times, and to include mineral carbonation as a separate heading

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the policy implications of slow leakage from storage sites, BELGIUM suggested that a reference to leakage of “small” quantities of carbon dioxide offsetting benefits from CCS is misleading, and proposed, and delegates agreed, to delete “small

” Supported by NORWAY and the US, BELGIUM proposed distinguishing more clearly between leakage from ocean and geological storage

 JAPAN underscored that an 85% retention rate can be achieved when carbon dioxide is injected to an ocean depth of 3000 meters, and noted parallels between ocean and geological storage

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana"> <font size="2">What are the legal and regulatory issues for implementing carbon dioxide storage? </font> <font size="2">Delegates agreed to add ï¿½<i>inter alia</i>ï¿½ before the list of existing regulations that could be directly applicable to geological storage, and to add ï¿½pollution controlsï¿½ to the list, as proposed by NORWAY

 A reference to US property rights was removed, as suggested by CANADA and supported by the US and EGYPT, and replaced with a reference to subsurface property rights

 The NETHERLANDS requested inclusion of reference to cross-border geological storage

 After JAPAN noted that the OSPAR Convention is a regional treaty, a paragraph elaborating on the OSPAR and London conventions was deleted

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana"> <font size="2">What are the Gaps in Knowledge? </font> <font size="2">AUSTRIA, with support from GERMANY, BELGIUM, and others, proposed the addition of a new section in the SPM, which notes that there are gaps in knowledge regarding some aspects of CCS, and that increasing knowledge and experience would reduce uncertainties and facilitate decision making

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In presenting the proposal, Germany noted that renewable energy is dealt with only briefly in the AR4, and that, together with energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and technologies represent a major mitigation option that remains to be addressed in depth

 On a possible process and timeline, Germany suggested holding a scoping meeting after approval of the three Working Group reports for the AR4 so as not to interfere with the AR4 process or with possible preparations for a fifth assessment

 She added that to avoid resource bottlenecks and overstretching of the IPCC budget, Germany intended to support the organization of this scoping meeting

 Egypt, with various others, suggested expanding the scope of the Special Report to include energy efficiency

 The UK noted a range of possible topics for a Special Report, in particular the function of capital markets in energy investment, and, with France and Switzerland, preferred postponing deliberation of this until the next IPCC session to allow for further consideration

 Saudi Arabia, China and the US said the proposal was premature given limited human and financial resources

 Germany restated its willingness to provide funding for the scoping meeting but that it could not yet confirm that this will include travel funding

 The Panel concluded that Germany and other interested countries would be responsible for organizing financial support for travel costs

 Austria asked whether there were likely to be requests for IPCC contributions to the five-year programme of work on adaptation, and Thorgeirsson responded that while no new requests are anticipated at this time, more interaction between the IPCC and UNFCCC is expected as the AR4 moves forward

 Noting that the IPCC’s terms of reference have served the organization well, Australia, with support from Switzerland, the UK, Canada, New Zealand, Germany, Peru and others, suggested that a short-term review by a small team working with the IPCC Chair might be preferable to a lengthier review at this time

 Kenya suggested that a review might include consideration of active work with the scientific community in areas of comparative advantage and capacity building in developing countries, and Australia, with Chair Pachauri, noted that some scope for capacity building exists within the current terms of reference

 Chair Pachauri thanked the Government of Mauritius, the Secretariat, delegates and participants, and gaveled the meeting to a close at 5:47 pm

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The discussion on the 2006 Guidelines was slowed down at the outset by an unusual request from Russia for the IPCC Secretariat to make available in print form all government comments on the draft 2006 Guidelines (which amounted to over 200 pages), and the clear objection of Brazil to the treatment of flooded lands in the volume on AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use)

 Brazil considered that the carbon flux methodology used in the chapter on wetlands for estimating emissions from flooded lands, for example, could lead to overestimations when applied in a tropical region

 In contrast, Canada felt that this methodology represented an improvement on methodologies previously applied

 Reaching consensus required some negotiation, and in the end, both the carbon stock change method preferred by Brazil and flux method preferred by Canada were included

 The US and Australia stressed the importance of protecting the integrity of the IPCC by limiting its role to one of assessing the available literature, with the development of new emission scenarios taking place wholly within the scientific community

 Others, including Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and most developing countries, argued that the IPCC should coordinate those efforts to ensure consistency, comparability, transparency, and the participation of developing country experts

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> ADAPTATION: Tanzania and the Philippines said adaptation should have the same status as mitigation, expressing concerns that it had not yet been seriously addressed

 Tuvalu underscored adaptation as a crucial issue, and called for urgent action rather than studies or pilot projects, implementation of UNFCCC Article 4

 The Philippines highlighted the need for innovative ways of financing

 Egypt noted that mitigation efforts in developing countries are receiving more support than adaptation measures through the CDM

 Australia stressed technology and land-use approaches, welcoming a COP initiative to reduce deforestation in developing countries

 Argentina said means should be found to ensure that CDM implementation results in technology transfer

” Tanzania said the problem cannot be left to the market alone, noting that obstacles to developing country participation, such as inadequate institutional capacities and lack of awareness, must first be addressed

 Thailand underscored that the CDM is not the sole mechanism for technology transfer and noted that there is a limit to what market mechanisms can do

 He said de-linking growth from emissions is possible, citing Sweden as an example, where the economy grew 30% during a period when greenhouse gas emissions actually declined

 Canada called for better deployment of existing technologies and aggressive diffusion and demonstration of innovative technologies

 Norway urged discussion on a sectoral approach and on financing

 Uganda stated that all the issues being taken up in the Dialogue eventually come down to technology, and expressed concerns that a market approach could further exacerbate the economic imbalance between different developing countries

 Ghana said the three Rio conventions (on desertification, biodiversity and climate change) should be addressed together in order to achieve sustainable development

 The Netherlands noted that one barrier to low carbon technologies is that climate change costs are not reflected in prices

 France said infrastructure choices must allow for development and also for low emission paths

 China urged intensifying efforts to implement the Convention rather than considering changing the basic principles or developing a new mechanism

 Nigeria, for the AFRICAN GROUP, lamented the low level of commitments from some Annex I countries, including the lack of resources for capacity building and technology transfer

 With INDIA, he called for stricter commitments for the second commitment period

 INDIA added that more extensive use of the CDM would help to facilitate equitable burden sharing among Annex I countries through lower compliance costs and would encourage Annex I parties to adopt deeper reduction targets, while contributing to adaptation efforts through the 2% levy on CDM projects

 Tuvalu, speaking for AOSIS, stressed the need for significant contributions from all parties and, with BOLIVIA, said the 2<sup>o</sup>C target is not ambitious enough

 EGYPT underscored the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities

 SINGAPORE stressed that AWG specifically addresses Annex I commitments and drew attention to the importance of market mechanisms

 The proposal to add Belarus to Annex B (FCCC/KP/CMP/2006/2), which lists countries that have agreed under the Protocol to cut their emissions, and sets out each country’s specific target, was first raised in COP/MOP plenary on 10 November, before being referred to informal consultations conducted by Thelma Krug (Brazil)

 These concerns related primarily to technical and legal uncertainties and also to the “level of commitment” proposed by Belarus in terms of its suggested emissions target

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body">Regarding the technical and legal implications of Belarus joining Annex B, a number of countries raised questions about the proposal, given that this would be the first amendment to the Protocol

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body">Another major point of discussion was over the “level of commitment,” with Belarus originally proposing a 5% reduction in its emissions from 1990 in the first commitment period of 2008-2012

 Canada, Japan, the EU and others questioned the scientific basis for this level of commitment, with one developed country noting that, while it reflects a similar level of commitment made by Annex B parties in 1997, the “world has changed” since then, and a decision on the level of commitment should now take into account updated scientific information

 Several parties also noted that, with discussions on post-2012 action now taking place, any decision on the Belarus proposal should send a positive signal about future levels of commitments

 In addition, there were also questions over how Belarus planned to use the flexible mechanisms, and particularly emissions trading, since it appeared very likely that the country would produce fewer emissions than its target for the period 2008-2012, and would therefore have the option of selling emissions reduction credits to other Annex B parties

 Finally, there were also questions about how Belarus might apply forest management activities set out under Protocol Article 3

 However, Belarus sought to resolve the issues at <a href="/climate/cop12/" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">COP/MOP 2</a>, eventually proposing clarifications and compromises in an attempt to assure other parties that it was not seeking to “take advantage” either of Article 3

 After taking the matter to the high-level ministerial consultations held during <a href="/climate/cop12/" style="text-decoration: none" target="_blank">COP/MOP 2</a>’s final hours, a compromise agreement was finally reached on a decision to amend the Protocol to add Belarus to Annex B, with an emissions reduction target of minus 8%

9), the COP/MOP adopts the amendment adding Belarus to Annex B

 In addition to provisions similar to those contained in the COP decision, the COP/MOP endorses the COP decision to approve the protocol amending the agreement between the Government of Germany, the UN and UNFCCC to reflect the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol

 It was then referred to a contact group chaired by Paul Watkinson (France)

 While the EU, Canada, Japan and others preferred to focus on short-term issues, others, such as Argentina, wanted to discuss both short- and long-term issues

 These included a proposal from Brazil for a new paragraph inviting parties to submit their views on the issue by 23 February 2007, although a separate proposal by Brazil to establish an <i>ad hoc</i> special review team on the matter was not accepted

” In contrast, Brazil, the EU and others supported issuing the credits to another institution and either canceling the credits or using them to fund activities that include means to phase out the production and consumption of HCFCs

 China requested a reference to model uncertainty

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Following comments from Saudi Arabia and Austria, text stating that “warming of the climate system has been detected and attributed to anthropogenic forcing” was modified, with language separating the detection and attribution components into two separate sentences

 In the opening boxed text, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain called for language noting the lack of consideration of mitigation scenarios in the WGI assessment

 They were opposed by Kenya, China, Saudi Arabia, and Australia, who said WGI does not deal with mitigation and that this issue was already clear from other references in the SPM

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On “committed warming” (the warming expected to occur even if all radiative forcing agents remained at 2000 levels), China, with the Netherlands, Morocco and others, objected to the wording “committed” given the potential for misinterpretation

 Switzerland, supported by Belgium, Germany and others, proposed replacing it with “resulting” warming

 Austria, supported by Ireland, preferred retention of “committed” as a precise scientific term

 With Norway, he suggested improving the definition by using text from the underlying report

 Given the recent attention from the media, Belgium, supported by France, called for the new range for the AR4 warming projections to be clearly stated within the text to enable a straightforward comparison to the previous TAR range of 1

 The Netherlands, Austria, Germany, and Australia asked that an explanation to this effect be incorporated into the text, and China and Cuba cautioned against negative language to describe the approach used in the TAR

 In the contact group, Germany asked that a column be added to a table of 21</font><sup><span style="line-height: 120%"><font size="2">st</font></span></sup><font size="2"> century warming and sea level rise projections (Table SPM-2) to denote carbon dioxide emission levels

 China, supported by Switzerland, asked, and participants agreed, that the words “Year 2000 Committed” be rephrased to “Constant Year 2000 Concentrations

 Italy stressed that the AR4 message to the general public will be whether the problem is deemed to be more or less serious than before

 The UK, supported by Germany and Belgium, called for a statement at the end of the section to indicate that there are other warming possibilities outside the SRES scenarios

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Regarding differences in sea level rise projections between the TAR and AR4, Germany noted that this could be a source of confusion for the media

 Germany stressed the potentially important contributions from melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets

 Austria underscored the importance of reflecting in the text that the rates are current best estimates, but that they could increase or decrease in the future

 Germany emphasized the need for clarity on what is and what is not included in the sea level rise projections, and Kenya, Sudan, the US, Canada, and others asked that the language remain understandable

 Belgium suggested, and participants agreed, to make it clear that uncertainties in climate-carbon cycle feedbacks are also not included in sea level rise projections due to lack of published literature

 Noting recent observations on accelerated ice flow, Germany requested additional language indicating a discrepancy between positive recent observations of ice sheet flow and negative projections from models

 Regarding regional scale projections on the possibility of a large abrupt transition of the meridional overturning circulation, Germany suggested changing the term <i>very unlikelyy</i> to <i>unlikely</i> as many studies do not include the possibility of melt water from Greenland, but the Coordinating Lead Authors explained their rationale, noting that possibility was well below the <i>very unlikely</i> definition (a 1 in 10 possibility)

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Regarding the impact of carbon cycle feedbacks on atmospheric carbon dioxide stabilization, China expressed concern about the uncertainty in using only three models to ascertain needed reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and asked for the associated sentences to be removed

 Mexico suggested referring to “future” temperatures in Greenland to clarify that it is a comparison

 China added that such a comparison could lead policy makers to the conclusion that in the next 100 years we might experience events such as those 125,000 years ago

 Noting its willingness to finish approval of the SPM, China agreed to the proposed text

 Belgium proposed using language “linear contrails” instead of “linear contrail cirrus,” to which delegates also agreed

 Ghana, for the G-77/China, wanted the body to be under the authority of the COP and to submit reports both to SBSTA and SBI

 This was opposed by the US, Japan and Canada, which preferred it to report to the SBSTA, with certain relevant items being forwarded to the SBI

 Germany, for the EU, expressed disappointment that these discussions could not be concluded but highlighted the progress made in “recognizing the importance of an effective institutional arrangement, access to financing and suitable indicators for monitoring and evaluating effectiveness to the development, deployment, diffusion and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries

” Australia, for the Umbrella Group, said the proposed multilateral fund on technology transfer, which has been advocated by developing countries, is preventing consensus on this issue

 Brazil maintained that it was premature to start a discussion of a change in limit since the decision on small-scale A/R was only taken at COP 10, and with Australia, the EU and others, noted market-related problems unrelated to the <a href="http://cdm

 Bolivia, Chile and Malaysia agreed that the size of projects was probably not the only problem, but believed there was enough experience on difficulties with developing projects to merit a revision of the limit

 Bolivia added that the window of opportunity for inclusion of projects in the first commitment period was closing, and Canada recalled that discussions at COP 9 did not include a calculation of the implications of the tonnage limit and suggested the <a href="http://cdm

 However, China and India stated their opposition to an increase in the limit

 While Japan also supported addressing the simplification of modalities, Tuvalu (on behalf of AOSIS), Brazil, and the EU stressed that the decision on small-scale A/R project activities was part of a balanced package agreed at COP 9 and opposed opening the discussion

 Japan and the EU asked for the agenda item to be deleted since it was addressed elsewhere in the SB’s agenda

 Japan stressed the need for a common understanding of factors and criteria to evaluate mitigation potential on a sectoral basis

 Iceland noted many parties’ declarations of long-term targets and praised these national voluntary actions as building blocks for a future regime

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"> On the analysis of mitigation potentials, several Annex I parties, including Norway, Canada and Japan, stressed the importance of placing Annex I mitigation efforts in a global context

 Tuvalu proposed addressing commitments for adaptation, while the EU noted that funding for adaptation should be considered under the Protocol Article 9 review

 Invoking time constraints, China, supported by Saudi Arabia, argued that issues covered during the AWG round-table should not be negotiated by the AWG

 Opposed by the EU and Norway, China proposed deleting a bullet point indicating, <i> inter alia</i>, that mitigation efforts during the next few decades will to a large extent determine the long-term temperature increase and climate change impacts

 Brazil reflected on the positive exchange of ideas while adding that discussions disconnected from effective negotiations “cannot prosper,” and South Africa identified a variety of possible options for “moving forward” during COP 13, including a new agenda item leading to policy level discussions and negotiations

 Some of the most interesting ones included presentations by South Africa and India on adaptation, by the EU on its new climate policies and emission reduction targets for 2020, and by the International Energy Agency, Japan and China on energy

 The Convention Dialogue workshop also indicated some other areas of possible convergence, notably sectoral approaches, with some participants predicting that key developing countries such as China and Brazil might be willing to consider “no-lose” targets for some sectors of their economies

 The message from Brazil and South Africa that they would be open to continuing the Dialogue in some strengthened format after Bali clearly ranks as one of the most noteworthy outcomes from Bonn

 A contact group and informal negotiations were facilitated by Howard Bamsey (Australia) and Sandea De Wet (South Africa)

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"> On the nature of the process, Japan proposed that the COP adopt a decision on the formation of a new <i>ad hoc</i> working group under the Convention

 China called for parallel but independent processes under the Convention and the Protocol

 While the EU and developing countries favored this text, the US, Canada, Japan and the Russian Federation argued that it was overly-prescriptive and was attempting to prejudge the outcome of the process

 While the US, Canada and others sought stronger language on developing country action/commitments, the G-77/China opposed this, and instead sought to place the focus on language dealing with Annex I commitments

 Papua New Guinea asked the US to “get out of the way” if it was not willing to lead

 After the AWG plenary on 3 December, discussions continued in informal consultations and a contact group co-chaired by AWG Chair Leon Charles (Grenada) and AWG Vice-Chair Outi Berghäll (Finland)

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"> During the conference, Australia ratified the Protocol and will participate in the AWG as a Protocol party starting at the fifth session

 Australia expressed support for the AWG’s previous conclusions, including “strong support” for the second option in the AWG’s closing plenary

 The first option, supported by Canada, the Russian Federation and initially some G-77/China countries, referred only to the relevant paragraph numbers in the report of the first part of AWG 4 (FCCC/KP/AWG/2007/L

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"> During the AWG’s closing plenary on Saturday evening, 15 December, the G-77/China, EU, LDCs, SIDS, New Zealand, Switzerland and several others supported AWG Vice-Chair Berghäll’s proposal to approve the second option

 Only Canada and the Russian Federation opposed it, with Canada objecting to a reference to only some parts of the AR4 and the Russian Federation preferring to refer specifically to Working Group III’s contribution to AR4, since this was where this text originally came from

 A contact group, co-chaired by Raphael Azeredo (Brazil) and Adrian Macey (New Zealand), was established and met several times formally and informally

 While parties agreed to request submissions on extending the share of proceeds to JI and emissions trading, Ukraine and the Russian Federation expressed reservations at the closing plenary, stating that this proposal would hinder the implementation of these mechanisms in their countries

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"> After hearing the report on the workshop, India and Saudi Arabia opposed further consideration of the Russian proposal

 Canada indicated that parts of the proposal could be considered as a part of the Bali roadmap and Australia, New Zealand and Japan noted links with the second review of the Protocol under Article 9

 The EU and Belarus supported further consideration of the proposal

 The issue was taken up in informal consultations facilitated by Djismun Kasri (Indonesia) and agreement was reached to consider aspects of the proposal in the context of the second review of the Protocol under Article 9 and the new <i>Ad Hoc</i> Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action

 Parties also adopted a decision expressing their gratitude to the Government of Indonesia for hosting the conference and to the people of Indonesia for their hospitality (FCCC/CP/2007/L

 Pakistan, for the G-77/China, highlighted the shared understanding that our partners “will not leave us again” and that “we are taking this step together

 Under the gaze of unprecedented media attention, India turned the final hours of negotiations into something approaching a Bollywood Blockbuster, with star-studded cameo roles by none other than the UN Secretary-General and the President of Indonesia, calling on parties to close a deal

<p align="justify" class="ENB-Body" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px"> In a defining moment of the Conference, at the final and dramatic COP plenary session, the US stood down from its opposition to a proposal by India, supported by the G-77/China

 Fired by a suspicion that developed countries had set up future negotiations that might relax their own commitments, while placing too much onus on developing country contributions, India deftly seized the momentum for the closure of a deal on the roadmap, in the full gaze of the world’s media, to introduce a new rigor to the delivery of developed country commitments on capacity building

 In the end, after phone calls reportedly involving Washington, the US delegation dropped its opposition to the Indian proposal, stung by rebuffs from South Africa and Papua New Guinea and lengthy applause from delegates and observers who favored the proposal

 In the AWG under the Protocol, Russia, Canada, and Japan lined up to oppose a reference to the 25-40% greenhouse gas emissions reduction range in the AWG’s report from Vienna, which included this and other quotes from the IPCC AR4

 Canada and Japan, which had argued in the informal consultations that Russia should be heeded, changed their position after a concerted campaign by AOSIS to insert a comprehensive reference to the IPCC AR4

 A feature of the Bali Conference was the shift in a number of positions when negotiators left the closed-door ministerials and returned to the plenary sessions, as illustrated by the pressure that came to bear on the US and Canada in the final COP plenary

<p>Rodolfo Godínez, Ministry of Foreign Relations, Mexico, noted the importance of this meeting for decision makers, stating that any scientific input is valuable to the climate negotiating process

<p>Adrian Fernández Bramauntz, Institute of National Ecology, Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, Mexico, stressed the need to improve observation systems and analysis, and planning scenarios, and said that even with existing uncertainties, actions must be undertaken

<p><strong>Experiences in application of different methods and tools and their adequate use: </strong>Balisi Gopolang, Botswana, discussed methods and tools used in Botswana

<p>Ahmad Shaaban, Malaysia, discussed his country’s experience in fine resolution regional climate projection for vulnerability assessment and adaptation in the wake of climate change

 He said Malaysia was working to further integrate climate change issues and impacts into national and local strategic and development plans

<p><strong>Plenary discussion: </strong>In the ensuing discussion, Cuba stressed that they do not have access to Google Earth or the World Bank’s tool

 Austria highlighted the benefits of understanding the limitations of each approach, but noted that decisions on how and what to spend money on are inherently political

 Argentina stressed that a participatory approach is key in applying an adaptation framework in order to gain social acceptance

<p><strong>Plenary discussion: </strong>In the ensuing discussion, responding to Biot’s presentation and citing different circumstances for different activities, Austria underscored the need to develop methods and tools in a sector specific context

<p>United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) stressed that when addressing vulnerability, the overall trend in projections must be consistent with observed variability, with the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico (UNAM) adding that it was important to look at trends of vulnerability and adaptation

 Japan said that in bridging the gap between policy and science, the costs of climate change must be taken into account, including costs of taking adaptation measures

 Jamaica hoped that developing countries, including small island developing states, would become more involved in developing tools

 Austria said there was a need for a more sectoral debate when it comes to methods and tools, and that cost-benefit analysis was not the only criterion for decision making

 He concluded with examples of PIACC’s achievements, including the development of training courses, with the next to be held in Bogóta, Colombia, in late March 2008, the production of outreach materials, and the ongoing development of a dedicated website

 Indonesia stressed the role of religious leaders in disseminating adaptation methods, and Numa highlighted the role of the tribal system in disseminating information at the community level

 Mexico shared its approach of supporting the development and implementation of methods and tools at the local level

 Japan stated that it is looking to develop partnerships with Latin American countries and to fund work under the NWP

 Cuba reflected on its experience of using two different climate change scenarios in two sectors and cautioned against following this approach

 RIOCC suggested a chart of comparisons of key areas would be useful for decision makers and Jamaica and CZM underscored the need for better communication between method and tool users and developers or experts

 Ethiopia explained that in his country, once people receive training, they often obtain find more gainful employment abroad

 Westermeyer also described the Climate Development in Africa Programme that is being developed and GCOS implementation in Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean

 Pakistan requested GCOS convene regional workshops, and asked about future programmes and processes to improve and select climate stations

<p><strong>Overview presentation: Ongoing activities and key issues for improvement:</strong> Constanta Boroneant, Romania, presented ongoing data collection and observation in Romania

 She explained Romania uses both automated and classic weather stations, highlighted the differences in results of the two types of stations, and said this was due to a combination of human and technical issues

 Boroneant highlighted the need for quality control and said Romania homogenized monthly seasonal and annual data

 She also provided an overview of methods and tools used in Romania, including dynamic and statistical downscaling and impact studies on crop yields

<p><strong>National perspective: </strong>Mamadou Diallo, Mali, explained that Mali has 20 primary and 50 secondary meteorological stations and said there were fewer located in the north of Mali

 He described a pilot programme to assess the changing climate characteristics in Mali to help farmers with drought resistance and increasing agricultural production

 He concluded that: the development of meteorological services in Mali is due to successful cooperation with partners like the WMO; continued cooperation is essential; and climate data should be used more effectively for development planning

<p>Abel Afouda, University of Abomey-Calavi, Benin, discussed initiatives on data collection management and use, highlighting the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis, which aims to improve understanding of the African monsoon, so as to provide guidance on methodologies, tools and approaches for adaptation

 Diallo noted new stations are being constructed every year in Mali

 Austria advocated a robust governance structure to obtain data, particularly concerning transboundary resources, and suggested independent bodies collect the data

<p>Access to data and associated difficulties were discussed at length, with Ethiopia stating that data is provided free of charge, except for the purposes of commercial research

 Pakistan explained that national meteorological services provide data to the WMO, and that access to data is free of charge to researchers and NGOs, except in cases where data is not yet computerized

 Indonesia said meteorological offices should focus on increasing data quality to improve predictions, and said the WMO should give guidance relating to adaptation to avoid overlap

<p><strong>Overview presentation: Ongoing activities and key issues for improvements: </strong>Francis Zwiers, Canada, stated that for adaptation, past and current climate data is required, and emphasized daily data enables the assessment of frequency of climate extremes and determination of future extremes

<p><strong>National level and national hydro-met services perspective: </strong>Ambassador Qamar-Uz-Zaman Chaudhry, WMO and Pakistan, outlined Pakistan’s weather and climate observational systems

 Chaudhry stated Pakistan is installing 300 automatic weather stations, to be gradually increased to 500

 He said pilot vulnerability assessments were undertaken and consultancy services provided to Guyana after serious flooding

<p>Manola Brunet, University Rovira i Virgili, Spain, emphasized the need for the development of high quality and high resolution climate data sets to improve knowledge of historical climate variability and change, reduce uncertainties, and ensure more robust and reliable climate scenarios

<p>Lyudmila Skripnikova, Uzbekistan, discussed gaps and needs in vulnerability and adaptation assessments of climatic systems and water resources in Uzbekistan, including the lack of monitoring of transboundary water resources, out of date equipment at some meteorological and hydrological stations, uncertainty in water use estimation, and lack of reliable non-climatic data for vulnerability assessments

<p>Roger Rivero, Cuba, presented Cuba’s vulnerability and adaptation assessment needs in the agriculture sector, and identified tools used for assessments in agriculture and water resources, including climatic and bioclimatic indices and process-based crop models

 Fuller responded that CCCCC has worked with countries such as Guyana, Dominica, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent, and explained that for funding CCCCC relies on execution fees for implemented projects, and has also established a trust fund

 Austria commented on the need to show decision makers the impact of using poor datasets; Westermeyer commented that GCOS requires regional champions to implement GCOS regional action plans; and UNDP noted the importance of considering non-climatic drivers of variability modeling

<p><strong>Promoting implementation and improvements in data and observations: </strong>Wim Monna, the Netherlands, and Julia Martínez, Mexico, chaired the group

 Participants discussed the need to improve national and regional level data, which contributes to global networks; the Russian Federation stressed the importance of homogeneity so that data is comparable among countries; and Ethiopia highlighted the need for high quality data

 Noting the move toward automation of observation stations and the varied quality of these systems, Pakistan said quality needs to be assured and equipment regularly calibrated

<p>GCOS cited an outcome from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report on the need to identify an authoritative set of information needs for adaptation policies and, supported by Pakistan and Canada, suggested the group build on this in its recommendation

<p><strong>Improving capacity for collection, management and use of observational data: </strong>Balisi Gopolang, Botswana, and Francis Zwiers, Canada, chaired the group and discussions focused on improving data collection, management and observation

 FAO, supported by CIFOR and Japan, emphasized the need to consider not just climatic, but also non-climatic data, with CIFOR adding that documentation of local knowledge and non-climatic data should be encouraged and facilitated

 Romania disagreed, stating the focus should be on climate data, and that non-climatic data is widely available

 Pakistan identified the need to define minimum datasets required

 Cuba identified lack of funding to build data collection facilities, stating neither the WMO nor most national governments are willing to provide this funding

 Argentina said in his country, the private sector now invests in data collection facilities to collect local data for their own use, but do not make it available to others

 Cuba, Botswana, Japan and Argentina said more training is needed, and Romania emphasized the importance of infrastructure

 France highlighted the need for data collection and management to be determined by intended use and users; and participants identified potential users such as modelers, scientists, decision makers and economists

<p><strong>Exchange and access to observational data and information, including stakeholder needs: </strong>Albert Fischer, IOC, and Clifford Mahlung, Jamaica, co-chaired this group

<p><strong>National scale: </strong>Ainun Nishat, World Conservation Union (IUCN), Bangladesh, discussed socioeconomic baseline information and scenario development at the national scale, emphasizing scenarios for planners preparing adaptation plans

<p>In response to a query from Tanzania to provide examples of adaptation to climate change, Nishat noted that in Bangladesh local communities have recognized something unusual happening with the weather, but that the government needs to be convinced to take action

 The International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) said that in reviewing NAPAs for small countries, using Lesotho as an example, she found different criteria are identified in determining adaptation plans, such as impacts on poverty and employment

<p><strong>Information Users’ Breakout Group: </strong>Beth Lavender (Canada), breakout group facilitator, began with three questions: what types of socioeconomic information are most relevant to vulnerability and adaptation assessments; which information is readily available or accessible; and how can access and policy relevance be enhanced

<p>Maggie Opondo, University of Nairobi, presented on a project initiated in Kenya, Mozambique and Rwanda, funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and UNDP

<p>Beth Lavender, Canada, stressed the value in integrating socioeconomic information into vulnerability assessments and adaptation strategies, and determining how much information is enough

<p>On tailoring socioeconomic information to suit the needs of decision makers, Canada cited time constraints of decision makers, and advocated building their capacity and skills to interpret and use the information, and share knowledge

 Ukraine said providers should advise policy makers and help determine the climate change component of information

 University of Nairobi suggested breaking down information for specific populations and communities and Sudan advocated bottom-up approaches for developing socioeconomic information

<p>The IPCC Secretariat is located in Geneva, Switzerland, and is staffed by the WMO and UNEP

<p>Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, Hungary, acknowledged the IPCC’s efforts to build and disseminate knowledge about climate change and noted its scientific input in catalyzing and furthering climate change negotiations

 At the request of Belgium, language in a paragraph on a recent expert meeting on Further Work on Scenarios was modified to read that “the workshop identified four pathways for scenario development, the lowest one contingent upon a scientific-technical evaluation,” and that strong participation from developing countries “and countries with economies in transition” included the participation of “40,” rather than the invited 52, experts from those countries

 Indonesia recommended an eight-year cycle

 Belgium proposed a circular, continuous cycle of reports in order to have a cycle of one comprehensive Working Group report every two years rather than a complete set of the three Working Group reports every six years

<p>Many noted that the IPCC’s work should be linked to the UNFCCC process, with Venezuela recalling the Bali Action Plan and the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action work programme for 2008 adopted in Bangkok in December 2007 and identifying the need for annual progress reports alongside the main assessment

 Sweden supported possibly delaying the next comprehensive assessment but in the meanwhile providing thematic updates as needed and a fast-track process for some reports

<p>WGIII Co-Chair Bert Metz supported by Sweden, Denmark and others, noted that new scenarios will only be fully available by 2012 and will not be fully disseminated in the literature until after that

<p>France, Germany and others stressed the importance of emissions scenarios and underscored the catalytic role of the IPCC in facilitating this work in a timely manner for AR5, in particular the development of low emission scenarios consistent with targets undertaken by some countries under the UNFCCC

<p>On Working Group structure and mandates, Russia, Australia, China, France, Hungary, the US, Sudan and others supported the current structure

 Uganda, New Zealand, Algeria, Peru and others recommended increasing consideration of adaptation in the work of WGII and WGIII

 Germany suggested strengthening WGIII’s work on adaptation, in accordance with its mandate to address solutions

 Noting the need to anticipate trends such as the growth of publications on adaptation, the UK, supported by Peru and others, proposed splitting the work of WGII on impacts and adaptation in order to have four working groups that could cope with a predicted increase in information

 In contrast, Sweden and Saudi Arabia supported possibly merging Working Groups, moving impacts to WGI and adaptation to WGIII, with a view to allowing for more integrated assessments

<p>Stating that it is ready to continue its financial and logistical support to the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI), Japan said that the TFI should continue as an independent body

<p>On special reports, China warned against having too many special reports and technical papers

 Sweden, Uganda, Mexico and others supported special and regional reports, especially on adaptation

 Spain favored considering climate change and natural disasters, and Australia called for addressing cross-cutting aspects of relevance to more than one Working Group

 Norway proposed preparing special reports on maritime transport and feedback mechanisms

 Venezuela supported Saudi Arabia’s proposal on preparing a special report on socioeconomic impacts of mitigation in developing countries

 Iceland called for cooperation with other conventions on interrelated issues, particularly, the Convention on Biological Diversity and UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and proposed a special report on desertification

 Norway, supported by Sudan, Finland, Iceland, Peru and Mexico, also suggested a workshop in collaboration with the WMO on managing risks of extreme events

<p>On scientific issues to be addressed in future assessments, China suggested extreme weather events and technology transfer

 Germany, with Cuba and Spain, called for strengthening risk assessment aspects of the reports, to pay greater attention to events with low probability or low confidence levels but high impact

 Finland also highlighted disaster risk reduction, and noted the need for IPCC assessments to be linked to other assessments, particularly the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment

 Iceland said the IPCC should be ready to address issues related to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and desertification

 Morocco emphasized cross-cutting issues such as economics and food security

 Kenya noted lessons learned over the past twenty years, saying that an increase beyond the current thirty members might create problems of unmanageability

<p>Many countries called for tackling the SYR earlier in the AR5 process, including early scoping on questions, to ensure more integrated assessment and enhance cooperation between the Working Groups, and France proposed setting up a small team to start the process

 Slovenia, supported by Cuba, called for an early decision on format in order to avoid uncertainty

 Kenya, with Austria and others, cautioned against prejudging the outcome of the Working Groups, and Saudi Arabia recommended delaying production of the SYR

 Austria stressed the need to understand the goal of the SYR, particularly regarding key uncertainties and concerns

 Spain recommended an uncomplicated overview of results, unlike the AR4 SYR, of relevance to policy-makers

 Cuba recommended establishing committees to discuss the relevant issues, particularly cross-cutting issues that could form the backbone of the report

<p>On a proposal by the Chair on a possible task group on economics, France, Sweden and others opposed the creation of such a group but suggested greater attention be paid to economics by the Working Groups

 Bert Metz noted the need to improve assessment of the costs of adaptation and impacts, but, supported by Sweden and others, opposed taking economics as a disciplinary focal point, given the IPCC’s decision to aim towards integration

 Kenya called for more participation by developing country economists and social scientists rather than just physical scientists and government representatives

 Brazil called for funding to enhance capabilities to address gaps in data quality and quantity in some developing countries, and Argentina stressed the need to increase involvement of institutions working on regional aspects of climate change, including through regional workshops

 Noting that the Summary for Policy Makers (SPM) is the main output of each of the Working Group reports and SYR, France called for broader distribution and wider access to hard copies and, with Italy, for more translations into non-UN languages

<p>Hungary, Sweden and others supported reporting on the carbon footprint of the IPCC

 On the TGICA, Norway noted the possibility of amending its mission after discussion of emissions scenarios

<p><strong>THE AR5 CYCLE: </strong>The issue of the AR5 cycle timing was addressed in a contact group co-chaired by Ian Carruthers (Australia) and Ismail Elgizouli (Sudan) on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning

<p>The UK, Belgium, Kenya, Morocco and Switzerland warned against trying to formulate detailed rules before the next Bureau takes office and suggested using softer language

 Switzerland noted the need to send a message to the scenario community to intensify its work and suggested indicating the end of the AR5 cycle in general terms as 2013-2014

<p>Germany, with Spain, suggested stronger language on taking into account the UNFCCC work programme, noting the increased demand for timely scientific information by policy-makers

 Switzerland also supported recognizing the link to the UNFCCC and called for consideration of special reports in this regard

 Co-Chair Carruthers, with the US and China, said that the proposed text reflects a balance between giving flexibility to the new Bureau and the need to send a message to the scientific community

<p><strong>STRUCTURE OF THE WORKING GROUPS: </strong>The structure of the Working Groups was addressed in plenary and in a contact group co-chaired by Mohan Munasinghe (Sri Lanka) and Svante Bodin (Sweden) on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning

 The Netherlands and Belgium stressed the need to continue deliberating throughout the next assessment cycle on the possibility of changing the structure of the Working Groups

 Hungary underlined the importance of ensuring the next Bureau takes the discussions held at this session on the future of the IPCC into account

 France recommended that the group also examine the financial and other aspects of proposals submitted

 Morocco stressed the need for a special report on food security and bioenergy

<p>Upon a query from Kenya, Chair Pachauri clarified that the current Bureau would continue to exist until the new Bureau is elected, but is not due to meet again

 Chair Pachauri suggested that Australia formulate wording for a decision to modify the Principles, and to submit it for consideration at IPCC-29

<p>WGIII Co-Chair Ogunlade Davidson reported on the scoping meeting for a possible special report on renewable energy, held from 21-25 January 2008 in Lübeck, Germany (<a class="linknegro" href="http://www

<p>Noting that only 30 out of the 120 experts invited to the meeting were from developing countries, China, supported by many others, called for greater involvement of developing country experts, and proposed a greater focus on the production and use of technologies that are applicable and affordable in these countries

<p>Belgium, Sweden, Hungary, Iceland, Finland, Cuba and others emphasized the need to address energy efficiency

<p>Indonesia expressed concern about concentrating only on large-scale energy systems and, with Spain, Argentina and others, called for providing a regional perspective

<p>Belgium, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and others also suggested including, <em>inter alia</em>, impacts on water as well as on food production, biodiversity, and environmental and social impacts

 Spain called for addressing barriers and technology transfer

 Finland suggested including sustainable forest management in the context of biomass use

 The Netherlands called for addressing policy contexts, in particular in relation to biomass, and suggested including urban development in the section on integration into energy systems

 Hungary, supported by Saudi Arabia, Finland and others, stressed the need to take into account all pros and cons of renewable energy sources

 Morocco proposed adding the topic of infrastructure sustainability

 Argentina referred to other bioenergy sources, including those using methane

 Venezuela, supported by Uruguay, suggested a greater focus on sustainable development, cooperation and technical assistance, and called for including nuclear energy

<p>Japan and Italy expressed concern with the tight schedule

 Kenya suggested more definitive language on the purpose of the fund and Australia, supported by Canada and New Zealand, proposed that it be used to provide postgraduate and postdoctoral scholarships for young climate change scientists, particularly those from least developed countries

 Brazil cautioned that this type of capacity building should result in enhanced capabilities in developing countries themselves

<p>Niger, supported by Venezuela, requested that some funds be used for two centers of research in Africa that need funding to continue to contribute to capacity building and training for scientists from least developed countries

 Venezuela favored giving support especially on choosing methodologies and scenarios in developing countries

 Kenya warned that these funds were “a drop in the ocean” of what Africa needs for climate change capacity building and recommended keeping the amount intact pending a thorough discussion of how to spend it

 Australia asked for costing of overheads and for more discussion on the way forward

<p>The Netherlands, on behalf of the European Union (EU), presented a proposal on enhancing the observer status of the European Community (EC) as a regional economic integration organization (REIO)

 Japan queried the implications if the EC and its member states have different positions on a particular proposal

<p>WGIII Co-Chair Metz and WGII Co-Chair Parry drew attention to various outreach activities of their respective Working Groups, such as booklets prepared with UNEP in various UN languages, and meetings on outreach in Japan, Hungary, Morocco and China in collaboration with the Global Industrial and Social Progress Research Institute (GISPRI) (<a class="linknegro" href="http://www

 Ghana stressed MRV on technology transfer, suggesting reporting guidelines, annual communications by Annex I parties, and linkages to the Convention review mechanism

 Pakistan stressed compulsory licensing

 India, the African Group, China and AOSIS stated that the private sector can play only a limited role

<p>Slovenia, for the EU, along with Japan, Australia and others, underscored the need to accelerate the process

 Japan said discussions under the AWG-LCA need to be consistent with those under the AWG-KP

<p>AWG-KP Chair Harald Dovland (Norway) opened the resumed fifth session of the AWG-KP on Monday morning, 2 June

 Algeria, for the African Group, urged ambitious Annex I targets in the range of 25-40% cuts by 2020 compared with 1990 levels, and Maldives, for the LDCs, urged deep cuts

 Tuvalu, for AOSIS, said Annex I parties’ commitments should take the form of nationwide targets and 1990 should remain the base year for such targets

<p><strong>EMISSIONS TRADING AND THE PROJECT-BASED MECHANISMS: </strong>Issues related to the flexible mechanisms were considered during the roundtable, and in a contact group and informal consultations co-chaired by Christiana Figures Olsen (Costa Rica) and Nuno Lacasta (Portugal) from 4-12 June

 New Zealand, Climate Action Network (CAN) and others opposed the inclusion of nuclear energy, and Brazil and others objected to CCS

 China, India, Brazil and others preferred maintaining the current scope limited to afforestation and reforestation projects

 Tuvalu, Brazil and others stressed these this should be considered by the LULUCF group

 New Zealand proposed decreasing the commitment period reserve while Tuvalu supported increasing it

<p><strong>LAND USE, LAND-USE CHANGE AND FORESTRY: </strong>Issues related to LULUCF were considered during the roundtable and in a contact group and informal consultations co-chaired by Bryan Smith (New Zealand), and Marcelo Rocha (Brazil) from 4-11 June

<p>During the roundtable, a range of ideas were put forward with Tuvalu and others arguing against substantial changes to Protocol Article 3

4 (additional activities) and Australia and others proposing listing LULUCF sectors in Annex A of the Protocol, treating it like other major sectors

 China stated that due to lack of negotiating time, rules for the second commitment period should be compatible with existing rules

 India, supported by Brazil, questioned the focus on LULUCF issues, stressing the need to reduce Annex I fossil fuel emissions

 Parties eventually agreed to “take into account” the principles in place of agreeing that the principles continue to apply, although the G-77/China, Switzerland and others preferred the alternative

 Responding to concerns raised by Brazil about adding new activities under Protocol Article 3

 Brazil also supported adding text on agreement on definitions and guidelines, and delegates agreed to include definitions on the list

 Canada and others stressed that the implications of adding a new gas must be explored before its addition

 Argentina, the EU, Norway and others supported controlling maritime and aviation emissions under the UNFCCC, while Singapore and other preferred addressing them through the IMO and ICAO

<p>Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar argued against addressing emissions from aviation and maritime bunker fuels, with Saudi Arabia stating that Article 2

 Tuvalu suggested considering financial instruments on aviation and bunker fuels as a source of revenue to fund REDD

<p>The G-77/China stressed that sectoral approaches should not replace Annex I parties’ national targets, with New Zealand, Japan and others accepting that they should be complementary

 Controversies emerged, however, between the EU and China and others over the mandate of the AWG-KP to consider sectoral approaches

 The issue was first raised in plenary on 3 June, and was considered in a workshop on 7 June chaired AWG-KP Vice-Chair Mama Konate (Mali) (for more details on this workshop, see: <a class="linknegro" href="/vol12/enb12370e

 Brazil highlighted the shortcoming of GWPs, while the EU and Norway supported their continued use

 Canada noted the need for proven methodologies, stating that GTPs are not yet proven

” New Zealand, the EU, Norway, Canada, and Switzerland supported using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for reporting during the second commitment period, but said further methodological work may be necessary

<p>The NWP was also the subject of extensive discussions in a contact group and informal consultations co-chaired by Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and Donald Lemmen (Canada) from 5-12 June

<p>Several developing countries urged a more action-oriented approach while the US and Australia stressed the need to focus on the most critical points

 India and others highlighted the importance of an expert group and noted connections with the SBI and AWG-LCA

<p>This agenda item was first taken up in plenary on Wednesday, 4 June, and subsequently in a contact group, co-chaired by Carlos Fuller (Belize) and Kunihiko Shimada (Japan)

 The issue was then considered in a contact group and informal consultations co-chaired by Audun Rosland (Norway), and Lilian Portillo (Paraguay) from 5-12 June

 Brazil underscored the importance of agreeing on definitions early in the process and on focusing on anthropogenic emissions

 Colombia and Cameroon stressed that discussions of methodologies cannot be separated from discussions of financial mechanisms

<p>The role of historical emissions was raised, with Australia, Gabon and others stating that deciding to base reference emissions levels on historical data at this point would prescribe outcomes and create problems with data needs

 India, China and others stressed the importance of flexibility in selecting a starting date or period for reference emissions

<p>In discussions of means to deal with uncertainties, Canada, India, Thailand and others supported referring to a “principle of conservativeness

<p>On displaced emissions and national and/or sub-national approaches, the US, Colombia and others objected to text on exploring how sub-national approaches can be used in the development of national approaches, stating that this raises national approaches over sub-national ones

” Colombia supported equivalent treatment of national and sub-national approaches, while Papua New Guinea insisted on addressing intra-national displacement from sub-national approaches but not national ones

 No major disagreements emerged and the group, which was co-chaired by Sergio Castellari (Italy) and Arthur Rolle (Bahamas), agreed on a short text that was subsequently adopted by SBSTA on 13 June

<p><strong>SCIENTIFIC AND METHODOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSAL BY BRAZIL</strong>: Parties considered written reports on the scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil, which seeks to explore historical contributions of emissions sources to climate change

 The issue was referred to informal consultations from 5-11 June, led by Washington Zhakata (Zimbabwe)

 The EU, New Zealand, Singapore, Micronesia and others supported the IMO’s work

 Kuwait expressed concerns about this issue being used to shift commitments from Annex I to non-Annex I parties The US said the IMO’s decision stems from its own mandate, which precedes the Kyoto Protocol

<p><strong>HCFC-22 / HFC-23:</strong> The establishment of new HCFC-22 facilities seeking to obtain Certified Emission Reductions under the CDM for the destruction of HFC-23 was addressed in informal SBSTA consultations facilitated by Jeffrey Spooner (Jamaica)

<p>Norway, Kuwait, Canada, the EU, Saudi Arabia, Japan and others, opposed by Brazil, Micronesia and others, supported inclusion of CCS projects under the CDM

 The EU, supported by Japan, proposed a pilot phase approach

 Gertraud Wollansky (Austria) and Mohammad Reazuddin (Bangladesh) conducted informal consultations

 Brazil and AOSIS opposed inclusion of reference to decision 1/CMP

2 and the roundtable, which Kuwait, Qatar, Norway and others supported

4: </strong>This issue was addressed briefly in plenary on 4 June, and then in informal SBSTA consultations co-facilitated by Anke Herold (European Community), and Nagmeldin Elhassan (Sudan)

 Japan, the EU, China, the US, Australia and others stressed the need to avoid duplication of work with the AWG-LCA

 New Zealand, Uruguay and Argentina underscored mitigation options in the agricultural sector

 Ermira Fida (Albania) conducted informal consultations on these issues

 The EU, Japan, Australia and others once again proposed joining this item with Protocol Article 3

 Gertraud Wollansky (Austria) and Kamel Djemouai (Algeria) conducted informal consultations on the two matters, with delegates ultimately agreeing to establish a joint SBSTA/SBI contact group at SB 29

 Chair Plume thanked delegates for their hard work and looked forward to seeing delegates in Poznan, Poland, later this year

<p>The twenty-eighth session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 28) was opened by Chair Bagher Asadi (Iran) on Wednesday morning, 4 June

 Maldives, for the LDCs, complained of funding delays for implementing national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs)

 Colombia highlighted extending the adaptation levy on the CDM to the other flexible mechanisms

 Two of these issues – on the CGE and financial and technical support – were considered briefly in plenary on 4 June, before being taken up in contact groups and informal consultations facilitated by Emily Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya) and Nicole Wilke (Germany)

1) and in informal consultations facilitated by Tina Guthrie (Canada) and Bubu Jallow (Gambia)

4</a>) was first taken up in plenary on 4 June and then in contact groups and informal consultations chaired by Leon Charles (Grenada)

 The US, supported by Japan and others, expressed preference for basing discussions on Annex III of document FCCC/SBI/2007/15

 The issue was subsequently taken up in a contact group chaired by Amjad Abdulla (Maldives)

1) was first taken up in the SBI plenary on Wednesday, 4 June, when EGTT Chair Jukka Uosukainen (Finland) reported on the EGTT’s work

1), a joint SBI/SBSTA contact group, co-chaired by Holger Liptow (Germany) and Carlos Fuller (Belize), was established

 The EU and Japan welcomed the GEF’s report, while the G-77/China said the report deviates from the Bali mandate

 These matters were taken up in a contact group and informal consultations co-chaired by Philip Gwage (Uganda) and Holger Liptow (Germany)

<p>In the contact group, China expressed disappointment with the GEF paper, and Ghana said the paper did not conform to the terms of reference given by the COP in decision 4/CP

<p>On the terms of reference of the review, Canada, the US and Japan, opposed by Ghana, suggested using the EGTT’s performance indicators

<p>The issue of performance indicators to monitor the implementation of capacity building was discussed during contact groups and informal consultations co-chaired by Crispin d’Auvergne (Saint Lucia) and Helmut Hojesky (Austria)

 Japan called attention to decision 2/CP

<p>The issue was subsequently taken up in contact groups and informal consultations co-chaired by Crispin d’Auvergne (Saint Lucia) and Helmut Hojesky (Austria), where the Secretariat provided clarification on the legal basis for the second comprehensive review of capacity building under the Protocol

 Saudi Arabia, for the G-77/China, emphasized the importance of the issue, while the EU and Japan stressed the need to avoid duplicating work under the SBSTA agenda item on Protocol Article 2

 After informal consultations conducted by Gertraud Wollansky (Austria) and Kamel Djemouai (Algeria), negotiators accepted a proposal to discuss the two items in a joint SBI/SBSTA contact group, with each item remaining under its subsidiary body, but discussed together and with each afforded equal time

 Japan expressed opposition to Saudi Arabia’s proposal to amend the Protocol to entail legally binding consequences for non-compliance, stressing uncertainties related to ratification and entry into force of amendments

1-3) was considered by the SBI plenary on 4 June, and during informal consultations facilitated by Adrian Macey (New Zealand) and Ana Maria Kleymeyer (Argentina) from 6-13 June

 In addition, a preparatory workshop was held in April 2008 in Bonn, Germany (FCCC/KP/SBI/INF

<p>In these discussions, the Umbrella Group, Switzerland and Ukraine called for a comprehensive review of the Protocol

 Several non-Annex I countries, including China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, India and Singapore, argued that the list of five issues in decision 4/CMP

 However, Japan, Canada, Australia and others stated the wording “in particular” means that other issues can be considered

 In the closing plenary, South Africa and Tuvalu, for AOSIS, stressed the importance of this issue, with AOSIS identifying it as a step towards innovative funding for adaptation

<p>In the SBI closing plenary on 13 June, Australia stressed that the second Article 9 review is an integral part of the Bali roadmap and must be given priority in Poznan

 It was then considered in a contact group and during informal consultations chaired by Karen Nicole Smith (Barbados) and Maas Goote (Netherlands)

<p>The two main issues considered under this agenda item were arrangements for COP 14 and COP/MOP 4 in Poznan, Poland in December 2008, and arrangements for future sessional periods in 2009

<p>Parties also agreed to proposals by Australia and others for the March/April and August/September AWG-LCA and AWG-KP events to run from mid-week to mid-week so as to avoid having delegates spend too many weekends away from home – an approach Australia referred to as “family friendly

 The SBI also notes concerns about the costs and availability of accommodation in Poznan, requests the Executive Secretary to provide an update to the Bureau and parties at AWG-LCA 3 and AWG-KP 5 in Accra, Ghana, and asks the Bureau to finalize this issue in Accra

 Informal consultations were held by Wenhang Huang (China)

<p><strong>On 4 June during the opening plenary, </strong>the Philippines, for the G-77/China, raised the operationalization of the Adaptation Fund as an issue on which it was seeking further discussion

 As a result of this, Adaptation Fund Chair Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) presented a summary of activities of the Fund, and SBI Chair Asadi held “Friends of the Chair” consultations

 The two tracks are in different evolutionary stages: while the AWG-LCA, born just six months ago, goes through what several delegates called its “infancy” of information exchange and the generation of new ideas (including various proposals on funding matters from Mexico, Switzerland, Norway and others), its older sibling under the Protocol is at a more advanced developmental phase

<p>The draft summary of views expressed and issues discussed during the workshop regarding outstanding methodological issues related to REDD, presented on Friday 27 by Helen Plume, Chair of SBSTA will be included in her report to the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Working Group on Long-Term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA) at its third session to be held in Accra, Ghana, in August 2008

 Outcomes of the work on methodological issues, including any recommendations on possible methodological approaches, will be reported by SBSTA 29 to the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP) at its fourteenth session, to be held in Poznan, Poland, in December 2008

<p><strong>REDD: </strong>At <a class="linknegro" href="/climate/cop11/" target="_blank">COP 11</a> in Montreal in 2005, forests were taken up under the Convention at the request of Papua New Guinea, Costa Rica and eight other parties, under a new agenda item on “Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate action

 These two aspects and the possible links between them were the subject of a first workshop held at the end of August 2006 in Rome, Italy

<p>This range of topics continued to be addressed at a second workshop, held in early March 2007 in Cairns, Australia

 Masatoshi Wakabayashi, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan, thanked everyone for their participation

<p>Kyoji Komachi, Ambassador for Global Environmental Affairs, Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, noted that two-thirds of Japan is covered by forest

<p>Yoshitsugu Minagawa, Forestry Agency of Japan, noted that REDD is difficult and complex but is also an innovative mechanism with the potential to curb global deforestation, given that global efforts on deforestation have not yet succeeded

 She expressed gratitude to Japan for the generous support provided by its Forestry Agency and to other parties who had helped to ensure wide participation by developing countries

13, including clear mention of capacity building, demonstration activities and a programme of work on methodological issues, and highlighted that policy approaches and positive incentives would be discussed under the Bali Action Plan at the next session of the AWG-LCA to be held in Accra, Ghana, in August 2008

<p>Martin Herold, Friedrich-Schiller University, Jena, Germany, presented on building national forest carbon monitoring capabilities for REDD as outlined in the Global Observation of Forest and Land Cover Dynamics (GOFC-GOLD) Sourcebook

<p>Frédéric Archard, European Commission Joint Research Centre at Ispra, Italy, spoke on the use of remote sensing in detecting and monitoring forest area changes and changes in biomass in tropical countries

 He noted examples of satellite imagery used by Brazil, India, Europe, Vanuatu, and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), highlighting that: forest cover monitoring can be done with a variety of methods, while cautioning that monitoring of degraded forest is challenging and local expert information is needed

<p>To questions from Brazil, Eggleston clarified that: default values in the IPCC guidelines are approved by the IPCC plenary; the guidelines aim to estimate the net emissions or removals of greenhouse gases that result from changing land use; and the IPCC good practice guidance (GPG) covers only managed land because human-induced emissions are assumed to result from managed, not natural, land

 He stated that Indonesia faces challenges on data availability, including a lack of data on historical carbon stocks, and on matching existing monitoring systems to REDD requirements

<p>Noting the loss of almost 82% of forest land coverage since the mid-twentieth century and a present deforestation rate of 180,000 ha/yr, Paraguay elaborated on his country’s attempts to address the situation, including through: a non-deforestation law; an environmental service law; and an innovative mechanism whereby those who do not conserve the required 25% of forest in their lands must compensate others who preserve more than 25%

<p>Papua New Guinea highlighted its experiences with REDD, noting the need for political leadership and clear objectives

 He explained that Papua New Guinea is testing methodologies for reference scenarios and has found that deforestation is less of a problem methodologically than is degradation, although both can use the same data set

 He said Mexico considers forestry and climate change as national security issues and is committed to a zero deforestation target

<p><strong>DISCUSSION: </strong>In the ensuing discussion, Mexico responded to a question from Brazil by explaining that land use subsidies in Mexico are changing toward improving and intensifying, rather than expanding, productive systems

<p>Brazil queried Paraguay on its preference for starting with a subnational approach, with Paraguay pointing to the need for more time and practice in monitoring and demonstrative activities and for creating capacity among institutions

 Guyana and others supported inclusion of positive incentives for carbon storage in countries with low deforestation rates and Nepal stressed community forestry

<p>In response to a question on logging of tropical timber as a primary driver of emissions from deforestation, Tuvalu cited a reference linking logging and opening roads to the clearing of forests and reiterated that cutting primary forest, even if followed by replacement of forest, still causes net emissions

<p>On international displacement of emissions, France suggested a carbon tax based on a product’s carbon footprint as the second best solution after the “all in” option

 Responding to a question on his proposal for a carbon deficit levy, Tuvalu noted the irony that some countries that claim to have reached SFM themselves are causing deforestation elsewhere through imports of unsustainably managed timber

 He agreed with comments by Guyana that compensation for existing forests must be addressed, but stressed that the market will not provide appropriate measures to protect those forests now because it does not cater to countries with low current deforestation rates and/or with high risks, and called for consideration of other positive incentives for those countries

 With regard to concerns expressed by Brazil and the United Kingdom about flooding the market with carbon credits, Papua New Guinea said that for small countries with a low GDP, market instruments are the only way to overcome the carbon emissions associated with deforestation, but stressed that industrialized countries must agree on much higher emission reduction targets

 She said India favors a comprehensive REDD mechanism including conservation, increase of forest cover, SFM, and reduced deforestation, with incentives for all

 On methodological issues, she supported: national level accounting; a baseline year (for example 1990, when India first adopted participatory community forestry programmes); and assessment at regular intervals (every 2 or 5 years)

<p><strong>DISCUSSION: </strong>In discussion of the presentations, India, in response to a question from the European Commission, clarified that all data used in her presentation was model-based, and that soil carbon content is modeled as making a significant contribution in the post-2015 period

<p>To a question from Nepal on estimating forest cover in mountainous areas, India said the problem is to be able to remove shadows when interpreting data, although the capacity to do this is increasing

 Japan acknowledged the difficulty in monitoring mountainous areas, particularly as data from Landsat is becoming progressively worse

 He stated that Japan therefore uses photos or ground-based inventory

 In response to Malaysia on the classification of forest according to canopy density, India noted that this has been done successfully in India for years and is a technical issue

<p>On a question from Papua New Guinea about the feasibility of Brazil’s methods for other countries, Brazil stated that its satellite technology is being transferred freely to anyone who wants to use it, cautioning that the challenge is how to use the information obtained to change undesirable practices on the ground

 In answer to a question from the Russian Federation, Brazil noted that estimating changes in carbon stocks does not produce information about whether these are due to degradation or to natural processes or whether carbon stocks may recover

 Guyana called for clear definitions of what is meant by selective logging, for example distinguishing between selective species logging and selective logging areas

 Cuba drew attention to links with legal and institutional policies and programmes, saying that management plans are necessary and policies should depend on the existence of national plans, adding that “this can’t be a one-size fits all” approach

<p>Brazil asked India whether they had considered existing methodological approaches such as the CDM

 On the latter, India recalled that only one afforestation/reforestation project activity in China had been approved to date under the CDM and noted difficulties in developing such project activities given high transaction costs

 In answer to Brazil, he noted that as the non-anthropogenic influences would be present in both the base years and in subsequent years, they would cancel each other out

 She said this initiative focuses on developing a market in cooperation with Papua New Guinea and Indonesia and aims, <em>inter alia</em>, to: increase international forest carbon monitoring and accounting capacity; undertake trials to demonstrate robust and verifiable action on REDD; and support international efforts to develop and evaluate market-based approaches to REDD

 The activities included: training of local communities in mapping boundaries and strata of community forests using GPS in Africa and Asia; monitoring deforestation in French Guiana by optical remote sensing; sustainable management of logging concessions in the Congo Basin; and a World Bank BioCarbon Fund project in Madagascar

<p><strong>DISCUSSION: </strong>In the ensuing discussion, Australia responded to a question by Tuvalu, noting that the pilot project was not about creating credits but about working out methodologies that would create enough certainties for a market to be able to function

 Indonesia took exception to Australia’s description of the demonstration activities, saying that these were only a small part of its master plan for the area

<p>The United Kingdom pointed out that the two basic approaches under discussion, for a market or a fund as advocated by Papua New Guinea and Brazil respectively, are similar methodologically, except for the question of market access

 Supported by Australia, she underscored the difficulty of predicting emissions based on historical trends and the resulting problem of distinguishing between business-as-usual and truly additional emissions reductions

<p>Saying that the world has agreed to mobilize around US$3 billion for REDD since consensus on future action was reached in Bali, Papua New Guinea reiterated the need to address policy approaches and positive incentives

 France drew attention to market failures, including the lack of willingness to pay for capacity building, and suggested that the market is not the only solution

 The United Kingdom, supported by Switzerland and Australia, emphasized the need for sound methodologies in order to get the resources required

 China emphasized common but differentiated responsibilities, and the need for deep and further commitments from developed countries, without which market approaches will not work

 Brazil emphasized non-permanence as a concern under a market mechanism, given the possibility of large forest die-backs expected as a result of climate change

 France called for further future joint presentations by UN REDD and for more deliberation on strengthening institutions that are already contributing to dissemination of REDD methodologies

 Australia noted the need to address cross-cutting issues and issues of governance

<p>Bangladesh, highlighting common problems such as the high content of carbon in trees outside forests in countries like India, Nepal, Mexico, and his own, called for support for regional and international collaboration on methodological practices

<p>Participants joined Chair Plume in thanking Japan for hosting the meeting

 Japan expressed gratitude to the people who had made the conference possible and called on everyone to keep up the momentum in Accra and Poznan

 Nigeria and Morocco suggested supporting small projects in Africa

 Austria, supported by Belgium and Togo, stressed regional and gender balance in the selection of scholarship recipients

 The Netherlands recalled that the IPCC is not a capacity-building organization

 Hungary and Belgium stated their preference for the fund to be used for scholarships that link directly to the IPCC and to commemorate the memory of the first IPCC Chair, Bert Bolin

 Kenya, supported by Mauritius, called for more time to consider the details

 The Rules of Procedure were adopted by IPCC-25 in Port Louis, Mauritius, in April 2006

<p>The Credentials Committee was appointed on Monday and comprised the following six members: Yadowsun Boodhoo (Mauritius); Ricardo José Lozano (Colombia); Natasa Markovska (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia); Mohammad Koba (Indonesia); Ingrid Martinez (Guatemala); and Aree Wattana Tummakird (Thailand), who chaired the Committee

<p>The Nominations Committee was also appointed on Monday and consisted of twelve members: Richard Odingo (Kenya); Yaya Bangoura (Guinea); Dong Song (China); Aysar Tayeb (Saudi Arabia); Luis Vayas (Ecuador); Pauline Davies (Uruguay); Edmundo de Alba (Mexico); Nathalie Burke (Barbados); Susan Barrell (Australia); Rajendra Prasad (Fiji); Anne Mette Jørgensen (Denmark); and Milan Dacic (Serbia)

 Klaus Radunski (Austria) and Ingrid Martinez (Guatemala) were appointed as tellers for the vote

 Several candidates were elected by acclamation: Dahe Qin (China) as WG I Co-Chair; Christopher Field (US) and Vicente Barros (Argentina) as WG II Co-Chairs; Ottmar Edenhofer (Germany) as WG III Co-Chair; and Thelma Krug (Brazil) and Taka Hiraishi (Japan) as TFB Co-Chairs

 The candidates were Francis Zwiers (Canada), David Wratt (New Zealand) and Thomas Stocker (Switzerland) and Stocker was elected

<p>Ramon Pichs Madruga (Cuba) and Youba Sokona (Mali) were in the running for a WG III Co-Chair position, however the elections encountered procedural difficulties unforeseen by the Rules of Procedure, particularly in the definition of simple majority if two elections take place on the same voting slip

<p>Ogunlade Davidson (Sierra Leone) and Jean-Pascal van Ypersele (Belgium) were elected by acclamation as IPCC Vice-Chairs

 Votes took place among four candidates from the Asian regional group for two positions of WG Vice-Chairs: Fatemeh Rahimzadeh (Islamic Republic of Iran); Amjad Abdulla (Maldives); Taha Zatari (Saudi Arabia); and Anvar Homidov (Tajikistan)

<p>Votes also took place among candidates from the South-West Pacific regional group for three WG Vice-Chair positions: Mezak Ratag (Indonesia); David Wratt (New Zealand); Neville Smith (Australia); and Fredolin Tangang (Malaysia)

<p><strong>PROPOSALS: </strong>IPCC Vice-Chair Jean-Pascal van Ypersele (Belgium), presented 14 proposals to help the production of the AR5, on behalf of the Task Group on Future IPCC Activities

 The Netherlands, supported by Saudi Arabia and others, asked to discuss the proposals in more detail, particularly on how to handle regional issues

 Austria, supported by Australia and Germany, focused on the importance of swift conclusions to inform the AR5 scoping meeting in July

 Germany, Austria and the Netherlands supported inviting governments to submit their views on policy-relevant questions for the SYR and on cross-cutting topics

 Sudan, supported by Switzerland, cautioned against an imbalanced and non-representative list of policy-relevant questions

 The US and Australia highlighted the iterative nature of the process of developing policy-relevant questions for the SYR

<p>In the contact group, co-chaired by Ian Carruthers (Australia) and Antonina Ivanova Boncheva (Mexico), delegates discussed whether parties should submit policy-relevant questions, issues or topics; the need for authors to have authorship over questions; and the need for dialogue between authors and the policy community during the assessment process

 China suggested that some themes could be incorporated as cross-cutting issues in the AR5, and Japan said requests from the UNFCCC should be a priority

<p><strong>Enhancing coordination among the Working Groups (proposal 6): </strong>WG I Co-Chair Thomas Stocker (Switzerland) noted that some joint expert meetings focused on specific problems are already taking place

<p>Austria, France, Italy, Spain and others supported two volumes but preferred a delivery in late 2014 along with the rest of the AR5

 China favored preparing a single volume with information on regional and global aspects presented in parallel

 China called for economic issues to be considered alongside geographic considerations in defining regions

 On a question by Japan about how mitigation fits this detailed regional approach, Mexico emphasized economic links and trade agreements and drew attention to mitigation policies at the regional level

 France, Italy and Turkey underscored that the Mediterranean should be considered as a separate region

 Norway noted that oceans are not sufficiently addressed within the existing structure of WG II

 Morocco stressed the need for close cooperation between authors of regional and global-scale chapters

<p>Deliberations continued in a contact group, co-chaired by Yadowsun Boodhoo (Mauritius) and Sergio Castellari (Italy)

<p>On regional divisions, Mexico highlighted existing regional organizations as a source of information and pointed to a vast literature on economic regionalization, while Mali stressed the importance of focusing on socioeconomic differences to ensure policy relevance

<p>On integration of adaptation and mitigation, Mexico emphasized the need to link adaptation and mitigation for sustainable development planning

 Japan preferred focusing first on adaptation as the basis for regionalization and then seeing how mitigation might be included

 France, Switzerland and China also expressed concern with attempting to integrate adaptation and mitigation

 WG III Co-Chair Ottmar Edenhofer (Germany) suggested focusing on infrastructure as a means to integrate adaptation and mitigation and, supported by many delegates, proposed holding a scoping meeting on regional assessments with a view to developing a SR for inclusion in the AR5

<p>On the timing of a possible SR, Canada supported delivery after completion of the AR5, possibly early in 2016, to allow sufficient time for models and other information to percolate

 WG I Co-Chair Stocker, supported by the Netherlands, the US and others, stressed focusing on what makes sense in terms of science

 He supported a Special SYR combining work across the WGs to be delivered, as proposed by Canada, in early 2016

 WG III Co-Chair Ramón Pichs Madruga (Cuba) and others supported this approach and noted that it could also ensure the inclusion of non-English literature

 IPCC Vice-Chair van Ypersele, supported by Morocco and others, suggested delivery immediately after the AR5 SYR, in early 2015, since delivery in 2016 would create a lengthy nine-year interval between the AR4 and the new regional information

 Brazil, supported by Saudi Arabia, expressed concern about the AR5 appearing as an incomplete report

 Brazil, supported by Sudan, proposed having a single volume in two parts instead of two volumes

 China recalled the decision agreed to in Budapest to maintain the format of the AR4

 France and Canada questioned the budget implications of new hires, and the US suggested that outreach could be done by the WMO and UNEP

 Brazil underscored the vulnerability of the Secretariat, but the Netherlands cautioned against bureaucracy and potential competition between scientific staff within the Secretariat and the TSUs

 Austria supported the request, highlighting the importance of institutional memory and quality management

<p>Belgium, China, New Zealand and others highlighted human settlements as an important cross-cutting issue and stressed the involvement of all WGs

 Mexico proposed that housing and construction – important sectors in developing countries – should be considered along with transport, energy infrastructure and water

 Mauritius suggested that health-related infrastructure, such as sanitation and drainage facilities, should also be taken up in the meeting

 Canada, supported by Austria, noted a need for well-defined objectives and outcomes for the meeting, and the UK called for a focused report attending to the transition to a sustainable low-carbon economy

 Brazil and Niger stressed the importance of engaging developing country scientists, and Sweden highlighted the need to involve experts on observations and impact research

<p>Expressing concern about work overloading, Mali, Netherlands, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, China, Brazil and Austria opposed the special report on climate trends and emerging science

 Sweden, the US, Kazakhstan and Germany supported it, and suggested identifying key issues and areas

 Chair Pachauri also invited Japan to host and finance an expert meeting on ocean acidification and marine ecosystems

 Japan said he would take the proposal back home and respond in due course

<p>WG II Co-Chair Vicente Barros (Argentina) presented a Scoping Paper for an IPCC Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (<a class="linknegro" href="http://www

<p>Australia, supported by Austria and China, stressed that the SR should focus on practical information for decision makers

 Benin, supported by Mali, suggested the SR begin by clearly defining the concepts of climate risks, extreme weather events and disasters

 The US emphasized that costs should include not just the costs of damages but also the costs of response in order to emphasize the value gained by preparedness and, supported by Canada, called for going beyond the climate extremes and impact information contained in the AR4

 The Netherlands called for the focus of the report to be on case studies to avoid overlap with the work of the AR5

 He also preferred to see the IPCC as the sole author of the report, while Norway, Canada, Japan, Argentina and Belgium supported co-sponsorship of the SR with the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR)

 Canada and Spain underscored the importance of linking the disaster management and climate science communities

 New Zealand noted that the topics in the SR are of critical importance to small island nations, and Sudan underscored the urgency of the issue

 Mauritius and Bangladesh drew attention to tropical cyclones; Peru, Colombia and Chile discussed their experiences during the 1997-1998 El Niño; the Central African Republic noted the importance of equatorial forests; Iran and Uganda stressed droughts; Mali highlighted floods and underscored the need for an early alert system; and Turkey, Chile and Colombia offered to contribute case studies from their own experiences

 Mexico suggested that the authors consider producing a synthesis report for policy makers as part of the SR and, supported by China, Morocco and WG III Co-Chair Pichs Madruga, called for special attention to the regional balance of the case studies

 The UK, with Germany and the US, called for recognition of historical contributions, including in-kind contributions to the Technical Support Units (TSUs)

 Norway called attention to its provision of CHF200,000 to the trust fund, with emphasis on participation by developing countries, and for the SREX Report, noting its intention to provide support for holding a meeting on this report in a developing country

 Spain noted an increase in its contribution of 30-35%

 Switzerland and the Co-Chair of the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI) raised further questions regarding transparency and clarity in the budget as originally presented

 The discussion centered mainly on the revision of an SYR outline developed at a dedicated SYR scoping meeting held in Liège, Belgium, in August 2010

<p class="textstory">On the scope, Germany and others supported the proposed separate topic on UNFCCC Article 2, with the UK and Norway suggesting to introduce it after Topic 2 (future changes) and before discussing transformation pathways

 In contrast, the US, Canada and Australia said UNFCCC Article 2 should be embedded within the structure, and not be included as a separate topic

<p class="textstory">The UK and Norway, opposed by Canada, supported a section on geoengineering in the SYR, with Norway highlighting the need to discuss the merits and risk of different geoengineering options

 Norway also proposed adding reference to impacts on the Millennium Development Goals in the topic on responses, and Sweden and Norway stressed that the SYR should communicate the co-benefits and tradeoffs between air pollution and climate change

 The US said the current structure is not easily comprehensible and noted overlaps, while Australia noted the SYR should integrate, rather than summarize, the three WG reports and that mitigation and adaptation should be addressed simultaneously

 Noting the IAC recommended that the IPCC address a full range of views, the Netherlands, supported by Slovenia and opposed by Australia, suggested including alternative theories, including the views of climate skeptics so they could receive scientific appraisal in the WG reports and the SYR

<p class="textstory">On timing, the US and the Netherlands, supported by Australia, said the WG III report should be approved before the SYR, with the Netherlands calling for moving the SYR approval date from September to November 2014 and for asking the UNFCCC Secretariat to schedule COP 20 in December 2014 so the AR5 results could be presented to the COP

<p class="textstory">Discussions continued in the contact group from Tuesday through Thursday, which was co-chaired by Antonina Boncheva (Mexico) and Nicolas Beriot (France), with David Wratt (New Zealand) serving as rapporteur

 Canada argued that science cannot support UNFCCC Article 2, although it is useful to inform decisions taken regarding UNFCCC Article 2

 Brazil said addressing Article 2 from the scientific point of view is difficult, and that Topic 5 is more political than scientific

 Some countries, including Canada and Australia, reiterated their view that the issue is cross-cutting in nature and that it should be integrated into the other topics

 Kiribati, the UK, Denmark, Belgium and Norway opposed, and supported having it as a stand-alone topic

 Canada noted that the topic had not received the same attention in the scoping meeting as the other topics, and with Australia, the Netherlands, the US and others, suggested drawing out information that is relevant for UNFCCC Article 2 from other topics and including it in boxes, possibly throughout the text, instead of having it as a separate topic

 The UK, Germany and others opposed presenting it as a box, saying that boxes present length and content limitations

 As a compromise, the UK, supported by Germany Denmark, WG II TSU, Norway and others, proposed a separate topic on risks and vulnerabilities before Topics 3 (responses) and 4 (systemic transformation and changes in systems)

 India stressed coherence in the treatment of geoengineering and a balanced geographical representation with regards to developed and developing countries

 Germany called for an expert workshop, not an expert meeting

 Chair Pachauri proposed consultations between the US, Japan and the WG Co-Chairs

 The Netherlands said the groups should decide on those issues that should be addressed by the task groups during the intersessional period

<p class="textstory">Responding to a question by Canada on organizational continuity and the possible contradiction with the recommendation that terms of office be limited to one assessment cycle, Sir Peter said that the term is defined liberally, allowing some overlap of WG Co-Chairs

7) were taken up in a contact group co-chaired by Conchita Martinez (Spain) and Chung-Kyu Park (Republic of Korea)

 Many also suggested the E-team serve as the basis for establishing the executive committee, with Belgium proposing that the E-team act as an interim executive committee

<p class="textstory">In contrast, noting that the IPCC already has an executive component, Saudi Arabia, the Russian Federation, the Maldives, Niger and others cautioned against increasing bureaucracy and called for clearly identifying needs before taking a decision to establish a new body

 Norway drew attention to the need for a body able to make immediate decisions and facilitate cooperation between WG Co-Chairs and with the IPCC Chair

<p class="textstory">On composition of the executive committee, the US, Australia, Mexico, Belgium, Brazil, Argentina, and Sudan questioned the inclusion of external members

<p class="textstory">The UK, France, Slovenia and others supported inclusion of external members, with perhaps different terms of office, in order to bring fresh insights and provide helpful input

<p class="textstory">Emphasizing transparency, the Netherlands, supported by Belgium, underscored the need for the agenda and minutes of the executive committee meetings to be made available to the Panel

<p class="textstory">On Thursday, many countries, including Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Canada, France, Belgium, Sweden and Slovenia, supported creation of an executive body to act on behalf of the panel between sessions and creation of a task group to continue work on its functions and ToR

 Others, including Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Lesotho, Sudan, the Russian Federation, the Philippines, China, Niger, Brazil, Côte d’Ivoire and Iran, said that a body should not be created until its functions are determined

<p class="textstory">The Russian Federation, supported by the US and Brazil, proposed changing the Secretary to an Executive Secretary to raise the image and prestige of the Panel without creating confusion with the term “executive director,” which is often used in larger international organizations, such as UNEP

 France said that whatever the name, the individual should have a strong management profile and the capacity to interact on a scientific level

<p class="textstory">In the Thursday morning contact group, Slovenia and the Russian Federation supported an option for an Executive Secretary, noting that such a title connoted more humility

 Spain, with Australia, supported requesting a task group to consider issues associated with the “potential” creation of an executive director position to lead the Secretariat, including mode of appointment, skills required and, in consultation with UNEP and the WMO, to make recommendations at IPCC-33

 Brazil said that it is first important to understand what the IPCC as a whole needs in terms of management

 Switzerland proposed that the Secretariat prepare and work on the basis of a yearly work plan approved by the proposed executive committee and presented to the Panel, and noted the need to define the relationship between the TSUs and the Secretariat

 The Maldives said the Secretariat plays a critical role in maintaining institutional memory

 During the closing plenary, Germany noted that the text still required full discussion as it remained in brackets

<p class="textstory">The US and Switzerland requested clarification on the proposed study of the Secretariat

 Belgium noted an additional budget item for an external audit and evaluation to assess the quality of management and that this would improve understanding of the real needs and could be helpful to the task group

 The US, with Australia, Finland and others, suggested that terms be slightly overlapping to allow the Chair and Co-Chairs to be involved in the work of dissemination and providing feedback on the process

<p class="textstory">Noting strong consensus among delegates on the importance of continuity and carryover of the Chair’s knowledge and experience when he or she steps down, regardless of whether one or two terms are served, Australia called for the development of provisions and handover arrangements

<p class="textstory">Noting that current terms are appropriate, particularly for developing countries or non-English speakers, China preferred not to limit the term in office to one term

 The UK and Switzerland noted that there is sufficient talent in developing countries and among non-English speakers to take senior positions

<p class="textstory">Australia, with France, Switzerland and Denmark, noted that there are two distinct issues that have to be addressed: continuity of experience, and ensuring growth, dynamism and the ability to respond to change

 China and Sweden said more discussion on this issue could be useful

</em>” Saudi Arabia, with Argentina and China, noted that the current IPCC procedure for the selection of Bureau members is clear and opposed the second part of the recommendation on ensuring the highest scholarly qualifications and proven leadership skills, saying that it is too judgmental

 However, Germany, Australia, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium agreed with the recommendation and called on the IPCC to adopt it in its entirety, as the current formulation in Rule 19 of Annex C of the Principles Governing IPCC Work, only vaguely says Bureau members should have “relevant scientific expertise

7) were taken up in a contact group co-chaired by Eduardo Calvo Buendía (Peru) and Øyvind Christopherson (Norway)

 Susanna Ribiero (Brazil) acted as Rapporteur

 Australia said that the scope of the report has been broadened into fields that are likely to draw heavily on grey literature, such as adaptation

 Mali stressed that grey literature might not be used broadly enough in reports, particularly on issues relating to developing countries

<p class="textstory">Austria, with Australia and Switzerland, noted that the decision text should not give the impression that the IPCC does not have guidelines on these issues, but rather that they are being strengthened and enforced

<p class="textstory">Believing the guidance notes presented by the WG Co-Chairs represent a comprehensive and useful treatment of the IAC recommendations, Australia asked about the relationship between the two and whether the WG Co-Chairs accepted the IAC recommendations

 On creation of a traceable account of uncertainty, Austria questioned how to deal with the issue of expert judgment and said that both should be linked to the tasks of review editors who should ensure that the uncertainty guidance notes are used properly and in a consistent manner throughout the report

<p class="textstory">The Netherlands, with Belgium, said further work is required on traceable account of uncertainty, and said the guidance notes should be finalized and make clear reference to their treatment of the IAC recommendations

<p class="textstory">Further discussions were taken up in a task group, which met on Wednesday and Thursday, and was co-chaired by Nirivololona Raholijao (Madagascar) and Darren Goetze (Canada)

 France asked that the ToR mention communication takes place in many languages

 The application by the Industrial Technology Research Institute submitted to IPCC-30 remained pending, due to reservations expressed by China

 He said that Sierra Leone had nominated Ismail El Gizouli (Sudan)

 Following election of Vice-Chair El Gizouli, the African regional group nominated Francis Yamba (Zambia) as Vice-Chair of WG III and he was elected

 Switzerland suggested UNITAR or UNU could take care of the fund, although in the interim, a new staff member could make the programme operational

 Australia and the UK said the fund should be an independent fund and should not access the IPCC Trust Fund

 Bangladesh and Pakistan said the fund should help build capacity in developing countries

 Sudan supported helping a new generation of scholars and scientists, particularly in the Least Developed Countries

<p class="textstory">The US, supported by Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands and Germany, opposed this approach, and said that countries, not individuals, should be selected for each group and then each group would elect its Chairs, as it is a government-driven process

 The Netherlands said that given the fact that the groups will consider important changes within the IPCC, it would be awkward for the Chair to determine who sits in what groups and who chairs the groups

 Germany said the groups should be open ended and the process transparent

 BOLIVIA reserved their right to return to the issue

 GRENADA supported improvements to the programme of activities and highlighted that there are outstanding issues to be discussed, such as how micro-scale criteria apply to programmes of activities, particularly whether they apply to the entire programme or to each CDM programme activity

 UKRAINE identified the need to consult on the level of the proposed fee

 JAPAN preferred focusing on other means, saying the proposed fee could discourage JI activities

<p class="textstory">On the post-2012 JI, UKRAINE identified the need for further explanations concerning the proposal to issue credits during the possible gap period

<p class="textstory">Parties then discussed whether credits can be issued from projects in countries such as Belarus that are in the process of becoming Protocol Annex B parties

 BELARUS highlighted that his country is ready to implement a number of JI projects using the Track 2 procedure, indicating that they are only waiting to achieve Annex B status

<p class="textstory">On the Committee’s annual report and its request to the COP/MOP concerning the legal status of Committee members, AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the EU identified the discussions under the SBI on privileges and immunities as the best way to address this issue and proposed reflecting this in the COP/MOP decision

<p class="textstory">On the substance of Croatia’s appeal, CROATIA explained that the Compliance Committee referred the case to the COP/MOP, as the Enforcement Branch’s mandate does not cover all aspects of it

 CROATIA expressed preference for addressing the issue not through the Enforcement Branch but through a COP/MOP decision indicating that decision 7/CP

 CROATIA underscored that such a restrictive approach is the reason Croatia finds itself in the difficult situation and that referring the case back to the Enforcement Branch would not lead to a fair and just outcome

 The EU highlighted the contact group’s “very specific mandate” to address Croatia’s appeal, while CANADA stated that the COP/MOP can take a comprehensive approach and also address the level of base year emissions

 AUSTRALIA indicated that while the appeal must comply with the existing rules, it is also possible to address the broader issues

<p class="textstory"><strong>PARTIES’ PROPOSALS UNDER CONVENTION ARTICLE 17 (protocols) (COP): </strong>Chair Michael Zammit Cutajar (Malta) opened the first contact group meeting

 He explained that five proposals were submitted under Convention Article 17 before COP 15 by Australia, Costa Rica, Japan, the US and Tuvalu, and a sixth proposal was made by Grenada for AOSIS in 2010

 AUSTRALIA stressed the AWG-LCA’s central role and called for COP decisions from Cancun outlining a way forward towards a legally-binding outcome

 TUVALU explained that his country’s proposal contains provisions on: mitigation by developed and developing countries; adaptation; risk-management and risk-reduction; technology; a fund with different funding windows; and immunities for persons serving under various bodies to be established

 He proposed undertaking the contact group’s work through informal consultations on: a shared vision, facilitated by AWG-LCA Vice-Chair Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe); developed country mitigation, facilitated by Christian Pilgaard (Denmark) and José Alberto Garibaldi Fernández (Peru); developing country NAMAs, facilitated by Pilgaard and Garibaldi Fernández; REDD+, facilitated by Antonio Gabriel La Viña (the Philippines); sectoral approaches and sector-specific actions, facilitated by George Mulama Wamukoya (Kenya); various approaches, including opportunities for using markets to enhance the cost-effectiveness of, and to promote, mitigation actions, facilitated by Giza Gaspar Martins (Angola); response measures, facilitated by Alfred Ndungu Gichu (Kenya); adaptation, facilitated by Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago); finance, facilitated by Georg Børsting (Norway) and another facilitator yet to be identified; technology transfer, facilitated by Jukka Uosukainen (Finland); capacity building, facilitated by Uosukainen; review, facilitated by AWG-LCA Vice-Chair Mukahanana-Sangarwe; legal options for the agreed outcome, facilitated by María del Socorro Flores (Mexico); and other matters – economies in transition and countries with special circumstances, facilitated by Kunihiko Shimada (Japan)

<p class="textstory">The PHILIPPINES sought clarification on how the information sessions on the work of the Transitional Committee and fast-start finance, and the workshops scheduled for this session would feed into the work of the AWG-LCA

 Stressing the need for transparency and inclusiveness, he proposed, supported by BOLIVIA and NICARAGUA, that REDD+ discussions should be held in a contact group, rather than in a spinoff group or informal consultations, to ensure the involvement of indigenous peoples and other stakeholders, and that facilitators should be selected from Annex I and non-Annex I countries that have no material or financial interest in REDD+ outcomes

 PAPUA NEW GUINEA, with GUYANA, SURINAME and CAMEROON, supported the AWG-LCA Chair’s proposal, with PAPUA NEW GUINEA highlighting that Tuvalu does not represent forested countries

 She underscored that she does not support Tuvalu’s tactics of targeting countries, like Norway, that are providing leadership on this issue

<p class="textstory">In the morning, SBI Chair Robert Owen-Jones (Australia) opened the SBI in-session workshop on enhancing the engagement of observer organizations

<p class="textstory">SAINT LUCIA, supported by BOLIVIA, BRAZIL, SENEGAL, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, ARGENTINA, CUBA, ZAMBIA and CHINA, proposed taking note of those Annex I parties that oppose a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, focusing discussions on the conditionalities set by those Annex I parties interested in moving the process forward and seeing whether the conditions have been met or can be met, prior to a round of political decision-making

 BOLIVIA called for concentrating on increasing ambition

 SWITZERLAND highlighted four elements: clear understanding of land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), market mechanisms and gases; implementation of the MRV package from Cancun; clear commitments; and reassurance that the AWG-LCA is moving towards a global, comprehensive and fair agreement

 She, with the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and JAPAN, opposed excluding certain parties from the discussions

 AUSTRALIA supported formalizing the status of mitigation pledges made in Cancun and “systematizing” the way in which the pledges are recorded

 CANADA underscored that her country will not commit to a second commitment period, but said the Kyoto Protocol has many valuable lessons, such as market mechanisms and LULUCF, for shaping the global climate regime

 AWG-KP Vice-Chair Madeleine Diouf Sarr (Senegal) asked parties to discuss how to move forward on the issues of transforming pledges into QELROs, surplus AAUs and carryover, and environmental integrity

<p class="textstory">SAINT LUCIA, with TUVALU, said the political context is very important and that such technical discussion was premature

<p class="textstory"> SWITZERLAND stressed the need to address technical issues and leave political issues to the political level

 AUSTRALIA said her country hopes to see a legally-binding treaty anchoring commitments by all major economies and that Durban should be a step towards that vision

 CANADA underscored a single agreement including all major emitters, and said a balanced package would be built on the framework of the Cancun Agreements and would enhance transparency through an effective MRV framework

 SAINT LUCIA, with TUVALU, expressed concern about taking up technical issues without further political clarity

 SWITZERLAND said his country supports the ability to leave <em>force majeure</em> events out of accounting, and clarified that they should be defined as single large events that are outside the control of parties

 AUSTRALIA said <em>force majeure</em> is key to creating incentives to include the land sector

<p class="textstory">The EU, supported by NORWAY and SWITZERLAND, said it would be a better use of delegates’ time to establish spin-off groups to allow technical experts to discuss the rules while continuing political discussions

 COLOMBIA, SAINT LUCIA, TUVALU, BOLIVIA, ARGENTINA and SAUDI ARABIA opposed discussion of technical rules in spin-off groups before setting the political context

<p class="textstory">On Thursday morning, SBSTA Chair Mama Konaté (Mali) introduced the revised provisional agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2011/L

 Recognizing that his country’s emissions have grown since 1990, Canada noted that emissions fell significantly in 2009 due to the economic situation, and that government action is expected to reduce projected growth

 Canada highlighted, <em>inter alia</em>: decoupling growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and emissions; plans to take a sector-by-sector regulatory approach, aligned with the US where appropriate; and important investments in carbon capture and storage (CCS)

<p class="textstory"> Switzerland outlined measures to achieve its national emission reduction target of 20% from 1990 levels by 2020, underscoring ongoing parliamentary discussions on, <em>inter alia</em>, technical provisions for new cars, a carbon dioxide levy on heating fuels, and possible continuation and further development of the emissions trading scheme

<p class="textstory">In the ensuing discussion, Canada explained that fast-start financing for developing countries forms an important part of Canada’s international actions

 Concerning compliance with Canada’s commitments during the Kyoto Protocol’s first commitment period, he said Canada continues to comply with the reporting rules and will assess compliance with the target during the true-up period

 On aligning with the US, Canada emphasized that this does not mean his country would only act when the US acts

<p class="textstory">The EU noted that the announcements by Japan, Canada and the Russian Federation to not commit to a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol constitute a step backwards that will influence the political context

<p class="textstory">Noting that a great share of his country’s greenhouse gas emissions originate from the energy sector, Denmark presented on its energy strategy for 2050

<p class="textstory">In his presentation, Bolivia explained that reaching the 2ºC target will require emissions to be reduced by 14 gigatonnes and that the gap between the current pledges and the target is between 7

<p class="textstory">The AWG-LCA workshop on developing country nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) was facilitated by Christian Pilgaard (Denmark)

 Chile said his country will use energy efficiency, renewable energy and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) to achieve the pledge

 Chile described the method used for defining NAMAs, using a one-page “NAMA template” that was sent to the ministries of energy, agriculture and transport

 Ethiopia outlined the steps taken, including estimation of current and BAU emissions, identification of abatement potential and analysis of the potential for green growth

<p class="textstory">Responding to questions, Chile noted, <em>inter alia</em>, efforts to develop a pilot MRV system and expressed support for transparency and international consultation and analysis (ICA)

 Chile also said his country is in the process of identifying sectors to be regulated and is considering a cap-and-trade system, NAMA crediting or other offsetting mechanism

 On the NAMA template, Chile noted it provides a framework that could be linked to the NAMA registry and to the information displayed to the public

 He identified significant potential for NAMAs in Vietnam, noting that 28 potential NAMAs have been identified, including 15 in the energy sector, eight in the LULUCF sector and five in the agriculture sector

 During the discussion, Costa Rica, Saint Lucia and Norway also supported a technical paper by the Secretariat

<p class="textstory">In response to questions, Vietnam noted they had followed UNFCCC guidelines when calculating their BAU emissions

 He underscored the new emergency plan in Bolivia to monitor and combat forest fires and the need for a long-term fire prevention plan

 He questioned why Bolivia should spend scarce resources to measure its forest reference levels to participate in a future carbon market, when it could spend these resources on addressing this emergency situation

<p class="textstory">During discussions, Kenya and Mexico noted that a number of countries lack the experience to undertake biennial reports

 Australia supported unpacking developing country pledges, possibly in a technical paper, and said biennial reports should focus on major emitters first

 Singapore said other non-Annex I parties should be encouraged to present their pledges at further workshops

 Chile supported the idea of a technical paper

 Brazil highlighted that the diversity of situations should be captured, and with the US, supported addressing these issues further during negotiations

 ALGERIA added that discussions had also addressed, <em>inter alia</em>, the guiding principles for the global goal and peaking, with many parties supporting historical responsibility

 AUSTRALIA, CANADA, the EU, NEW ZEALAND and SINGAPORE preferred specifying arrangements for individuals serving on constituted bodies and other entities established under the UNFCCC and not only under the Kyoto Protocol

 JAPAN said discussions were premature as the issue would be contingent on the outcome of the AWGs

 Bangladesh, for the G-77/CHINA, supported a short meeting of only the AWGs

 AUSTRALIA, supported by SWITZERLAND, the US and the EU, proposed considering “creative ways” of ensuring that work progresses productively

 Bolivia called for focus on forest protection and forest management, saying forests should be considered from a holistic perspective and not just as carbon sinks

 However, Ghana, for the AFRICAN GROUP, the EU, PAPUA NEW GUINEA, the US, JAPAN and others highlighted the need to prioritize work on issues in Appendix 2 of Decision 1/CP

<p class="textstory">The EU, PAPUA NEW GUINEA and others supported a technical workshop before Durban, while BRAZIL, supported by SURINAME and others, suggested a technical expert group, given the technical expertise required for certain issues to be addressed

<p class="textstory">AWG-KP Chair Macey then requested Gerhard Loibl (Austria) to report on consultations on legal matters concerning Protocol amendments

 TUVALU said the discussion of legal matters should be undertaken in a format other than bilateral consultations, in order to ensure that all parties understand one another’s views on the issue

 SWITZERLAND said the spin-off groups should have a mandate to make progress on text and INDIA said any technical discussions need to be in the context of the political context set at Cancun

 CANADA, the GAMBIA, AUSTRALIA and the SOLOMON ISLANDS endorsed the LEG work programme

 NORWAY recommended that guidance to the GEF be clarified before Durban, as otherwise, action will be delayed until COP 18

 He also noted the need to give immunity to members of the Expert Review Teams under the Kyoto Protocol since they are not covered by the headquarters agreement when working outside Germany

<p class="textstory">On means of communication, TUVALU and JAMAICA, opposed by the EU, CANADA and AUSTRALIA, supported an explicit reference to electronic means of communication, stating that language on the inviolability for all papers and documents, taken from the 1946 Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the UN, does not cover all means of communication

 Brazil, for the G-77/CHINA, called for full implementation of the CGE work programme, expressing concern over the lack of funding for regional workshops

 BOLIVIA stressed the importance of including indigenous and vulnerable communities in the process

 JAPAN said attention should be paid to the scientific and technical aspects of loss and damage

 Ghana, for the AFRICAN GROUP, with AUSTRALIA, Vanuatu, for AOSIS, and the US, underlined the importance of feedback and guidance from the LEG

 AOSIS, Argentina, for the G-77/China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for the African Group, Colombia, for a number of Latin American countries, Saudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, India, Singapore, China and Venezuela emphasized that the Durban outcome must include a decision to establish a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol

<p class="textstory">The G-77/China, AOSIS, Singapore, China, India and Venezuela identified the balanced operationalization of the Cancun Agreements as the second key outcome from Durban

 The EIG, with Colombia, underscored that a Durban package requires agreement on the legal form of the AWG-LCA’s outcome

 Japan, the US, Australia, New Zealand and the Russian Federation stressed operationalization of the Cancun Agreements as the basis for a robust outcome in Durban, and highlighted the importance of a framework for MRV, including ICA and IAR, and underscored the need for action by all major emitters

 Bolivia opposed market mechanisms and emphasized indigenous peoples and the rights of nature

<p class="textstory">India, Venezuela and the Arab Group supported an intersessional meeting prior to Durban

 Japan underscored that any further intersessional meetings must be efficient

 AUSTRALIA said the question of a second commitment period is intrinsically linked to commitments by major emitters

 SAINT LUCIA, ALGERIA, TUVALU, BRAZIL, CHINA, INDIA and BOLIVIA underscored that access to the flexibility mechanisms, including Joint Implementation (JI) and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), would be difficult to agree to in the absence of a second commitment period

 BRAZIL underscored that the Kyoto Protocol constitutes a “package” of obligations and beneficial mechanisms and that parties cannot “pick and choose” from them

 JAPAN said a discussion of the flexibility mechanisms is useful to ensure that they are better utilized in a new international framework

 CANADA noted parallel discussions under the AWG-LCA on market mechanisms and said discussions on whether and how the CDM fits in would be useful

 SWITZERLAND and the EU said the usefulness of an intersessional meeting would depend on progress in Bonn and that not all topics required the same time allocation

 JAPAN supported the proposal to convene the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP contact groups directly

 BARBADOS observed that both technical workshops and expert meetings are required and that outputs of any expert meetings should be brought back to a formal meeting

 SINGAPORE suggested that the intersessional meeting be a continuation of the Bonn session

 India presented on protectionist unilateral trade measures, saying that carbon footprint standards, including aviation in the EU ETS and the proposed American Clean Energy and Security Act, restrict market access by LDCs and other developing countries

 Kuwait highlighted the vulnerability of oil-exporting countries because of their high dependence on a single commodity

 Qatar and Saudi Arabia said methodologies should be available to assess policy measures for negative impacts, and Saudi Arabia added that a permanent forum would implement a detailed work programme, negotiate COP decisions, assign specific tasks to the SBSTA and SBI, review progress on implementation, and provide follow-up

 Venezuela highlighted the need to create resilience to the economic impact on hydrocarbon markets and called for a permanent forum

<p class="textstory">Papua New Guinea, for the Coalition of Rainforest Nations, called for the full establishment of a REDD+ mechanism in Durban through, <em>inter alia,</em> a COP decision on the modalities for measuring, reporting and verification (MRV) and reference levels, and financing options for full implementation of REDD+

 Norway said the Durban outcome should: serve as a foundation for a legally-binding instrument that includes all major emitters; establish institutions, systems and rules for achieving the 2°C target; and provide the way forward

 Indonesia said a Durban outcome should provide a balance between the two negotiating tracks, reflect the Cancun outcomes, and establish a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol containing ambitious emission reduction targets for Annex I countries

 The Philippines, noting that the Cancun outcomes include references to the importance of human rights in addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation, urged elaboration of this issue in Durban, including through the establishment of safeguards for vulnerable and marginalized communities

<p class="textstory">On numbers and amendments, Leon Charles (Grenada) noted that the aggregate scale of Annex I emission reductions, individual targets and conversion into quantified emission reduction and limitation objectives (QELROs) remain political issues

<p class="textstory">On LULUCF, Peter Iversen (Denmark) said discussions focused on <em>force majeure</em> and the need to ensure clarity and consistency in its application

<p class="textstory">On the flexibility mechanisms, Pedro Barata (Portugal) said there had been “little success” in streamlining the text but that parties had identified some issues that should be addressed by Durban, including the inclusion of nuclear energy under the CDM and JI, and the establishment of new mechanisms

 BOLIVIA said discussions should focus on reducing the gap between pledges and what is required

<p class="textstory">AUSTRALIA, with CANADA, said addressing climate change is best served by a regime that includes commitments from all major emitters and said that the regime constructed under the AWG-LCA should “draw together actions by all

” AUSTRALIA underscored the need to resolve technical issues related to LULUCF under the AWG-KP track

 AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND highlighted the need for coherent rules across tracks, noting that “a managed forest is a managed forest” regardless of whether parties take commitments under the Kyoto Protocol or under a broader climate regime

 The EU highlighted the need to consider positive impacts of response measures and, with AUSTRALIA, called for focusing on existing channels and processes

 The EU highlighted annual reporting by Annex I parties under the Protocol, while CHINA noted that the EU’s fifth national communication contains only 2-3 pages on the impacts of response measures and focuses on positive impacts

<p class="textstory">Saint Kitts, for AOSIS, and JAPAN supported forwarding the bracketed text to Durban as it is, recalling the significant effort already invested

<p class="textstory">During discussions, SWITZERLAND, TUVALU, Saint Lucia, for AOSIS, INDIA, SOUTH AFRICA and CHINA supported a resumed session of the AWG-KP in September or October

 COLOMBIA and AUSTRALIA suggested focusing on the substantive work and skipping opening and closing plenaries

 BRAZIL suggested the workshops should be held back-to-back with the negotiating session

 SINGAPORE underscored that the workshops should feed into the formal process but not be a substitute for it

<p class="textstory">On the means of enhancing observer organizations engagement through, <em>inter alia</em>, guiding the facilitators of informal consultations to propose the meetings be open to observers when they consider this would not impede negotiations SAUDI ARABIA, INDIA and others suggested deleting the text or changing the language, noting that this is the current practice and there is no need to reflect it in SBI conclusions

 AUSTRALIA supported retaining the reference, saying its inclusion would not imply changing the current rules but rather provide guidance to facilitators

<p class="textstory">On a request to continue discussions on, <em>inter alia</em>, increasing capacity-building and support for the involvement of observer organizations, MEXICO and SOUTH AFRICA suggested this should be considered particularly for developing countries observer organizations

 COLOMBIA said the current shortage of funding for participation by developing country delegates should be also considered

 SAUDI ARABIA and ARGENTINA inquired whether the consideration of this issue is under the mandate of the SBI

 However, several relieved delegates could be heard discussing travel plans later on in the day, with one joking that he was “looking forward to wearing his Panama hat <em>in situ</em>

 The US and ECUADOR welcomed the compromise

<p class="textstory">PAPUA NEW GUINEA underscored the willingness of many parties to include mangroves, tidal salt marshes and seagrass meadows under the agenda item on research and systematic observation

 HONDURAS, SURINAME, COLOMBIA, BRAZIL, TUVALU, GUATEMALA, the DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO, GUYANA and PAKISTAN supported the proposal

 BOLIVIA, with VENEZUELA, opposed this, calling the proposal an “underhanded” way to include new market mechanisms on the agenda, under the guise of a research item

 PAPUA NEW GUINEA reiterated their disappointment, underscoring the need to amend the Convention to allow voting as a means of last resort so that progress cannot be “consistently blocked by one party

” BOLIVIA noted that they would continue to seek consensus on the inclusion of the proposed agenda item on the rights of nature and the integrity of ecosystems

 He also underscored that the proposal by Papua New Guinea and Mexico to amend the Convention concerning voting constituted admission that procedural rules had been violated in Cancun

 NORWAY indicated “strong support” for REDD+, saying they would also provide financial support

 He explained that SBI Chair Robert Owen-Jones (Australia) was conducting consultations on the proposal to replace the item on economic and social consequences of response measures with an item on the forum on the impact of the implementation of response measures, saying the solution reached there could be imported to the SBSTA

” This was opposed by Colombia, Malaysia, Guyana, Suriname, Australia and Costa Rica

 Papua New Guinea, Guyana and Costa Rica objected to changing the name of the agenda item

 In response, Bolivia proposed naming the item “REDD and forest-related actions

” Bolivia noted that including items on the agenda stemming from the Cancun Agreements, which were not adopted by consensus, was not acceptable

<p class="textstory">On the issue of blue carbon, Papua New Guinea, supported by a number of developing country parties, called for including mangroves, tidal salt marshes and seagrass meadows under the agenda item on research and systematic observation

 Bolivia, with Venezuela, opposed this, calling the proposal an “underhanded” way to include new market mechanisms on the agenda under the guise of a research item

 It was subsequently taken up in a contact group and informal consultations co-chaired by Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and Donald Lemmen (Canada)

 It was further addressed in a contact group and informal consultations co-chaired by Peter Graham (Canada) and Victoria Tauli-Corpuz (the Philippines)

 India called for treating party submissions as the prime basis for negotiations

<p class="textstory">One of the central challenges in the Bangkok meeting concerning the agenda of the <em>Ad Hoc </em>Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA) was how to take elements of the Cancun Agreements forward, while taking into account that Bolivia objected to their adoption in Cancun

 Japan, Canada and the Russian Federation have declared that they will not commit to a second commitment period

<p class="textstory">Overall, expectations for the future of the Kyoto Protocol are low and some are wondering whether a “Kyotino”—with possible commitments from parties including the European Union, Norway, Switzerland and Iceland—would even make sense or whether it would be better to bury the Protocol in Durban

<p class="textstory">The 34th session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was held from 18-19 November 2011 in Kampala, Uganda

<p class="textstory"><strong>IPCC-28:</strong> This session was held from 9-10 April 2008, in Budapest, Hungary, with discussions centering on the future of the IPCC, including key aspects of its work programme such as WG structure, main type and timing of future reports, and the future structure of the IPCC Bureau and the TFB

<p class="textstory"><strong>IPCC-29:</strong> This session, which commemorated the IPCC’s 20th anniversary, was held from 31 August to 4 September 2008, in Geneva, Switzerland

 At this time, the Panel elected the new IPCC Bureau and the TFB, and re-elected Rajendra Pachauri (India) as IPCC Chair

 It also asked the Bureau to consider a scoping meeting on the SREX, which took place from 23-26 March 2009 in Oslo, Norway

<p class="textstory"><strong>IPCC-30:</strong> This session was held from 21-23 April 2009 in Antalya, Turkey

<p class="textstory"><strong>IPCC-31:</strong> This session was held from 26-29 October 2009 in Bali, Indonesia

<p class="textstory"><strong>SREX:</strong> The First joint session of IPCC WGs I and II, which took place on 14-17 November in Kampala, Uganda, accepted the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX) and approved its SPM

 He emphasized the significance of the meeting being held in Africa, given the findings related to climate change impacts and development challenges in the region, and thanked Uganda for hosting the meeting and Norway for its support

 He noted that extreme weather events and their negative impacts are apparent everywhere, including in Uganda, for fishermen on the Lake Victoria who experience reduced catch, as well as in his native Norway, which experiences dramatic flooding, shrinking Arctic ice and other events

 He thanked the Ugandan government for its hospitality and said Norway was pleased to have contributed to the organization of the meeting

<p class="textstory">Maria Mutagamba, Minister for Water and Environment, Uganda, expressed warm greetings from the people of Uganda and welcomed delegates to the country traditionally known as the Pearl of Africa

 She said that it is with great pride that Uganda continues to participate actively in the work of the IPCC and hosts this meeting, and thanked Norway, which co-funded the session

 She said that Uganda has already started experiencing extreme weather events attributed to climate change such as severe droughts, floods and increased frequency of landslides

 Belgium noted the lack of reference in the meeting minutes to the Expert Meeting on Geoengineering and the participation of media representatives in at that meeting

 Underscoring the importance and usefulness of the SREX, Austria said that, among others, this landmark report introduces terminology to be understood both by the risk management and the climate change community, identifies a range of practices and options to reduce risk, and provides clarity on what the most vulnerable sectors, groups and areas are, making it of tremendous use for taking appropriate actions

 Emphasizing the importance of the IPCC retaining distance from the policy process, the US, supported by New Zealand, Canada, Saudi Arabia and others, opposed the suggestion

 1) was first addressed in the plenary on Friday and then in several meetings of a contact group co-chaired by Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia) and Jongikhaya Witi (South Africa), with Samuel Duffett (UK) as Rapporteur

 The Netherlands underlined the enormous importance of the documents on COI for the transparency and integrity of the Panel, and its acceptance by the outside world

 Thanking all members of the Task Group, Australia congratulated the plenary on a “groundbreaking” COI mechanism for many international organizations, both in substance and in the procedure of how it was developed

 1) was first introduced in the plenary on Friday and then taken up by a contact group co-chaired by Eduardo Calvo (Peru) and Øyvind Christophersen (Norway), with Arthur Petersen (Netherlands) as Rapporteur

<p class="textstory">On guidance material, Belgium and others called for stating that guidance material needs to be taken into account in the preparation of the reports in addition to stating what guidance material is, while others cautioned against excessively normative language

<p class="textstory">During the final plenary, Austria noted that, although important progress was made, there is a need to further strengthen the Procedures, in particular related to the calibrated uncertainty language of assessments, to increase transparency and traceability of the decisions of authors so these can be understood in the future

 Australia proposed, and the Panel agreed, to record the EU’s concern in the minutes of the meeting along with Austria’s suggestion

<p class="textstory">Many, including New Zealand, US, Austria and Japan, expressed a deep concern about the delay with hiring a senior communications specialist who should be involved in the development of the strategy

 Switzerland underlined the importance of scientific integrity in the communication of the IPCC’s work, which often means “sticking literally to what has been said

” Australia proposed that a strategy should be forward-looking and contain a clear set of communications objectives: what to communicate, to whom and how

<p class="textstory">In the final plenary on Saturday, Belgium recalled its proposal to re-establish a Task Force on Outreach and Communications Strategy, noting that such a Task Force had existed but disappeared when Pachauri became Chair, and to collect written comments by governments to advance the issue

 Chair Pachauri supported the proposal and suggested Belgium submit it in written form

 New Zealand, with Malaysia and Australia, noted that there was no representative from Region V (South-West Pacific) on the WGIII Bureau, and that the revised text leaves open the possibility that someone from Region V is not on the WGIII Bureau

 Australia also highlighted that Region V does not have representation on the Executive Committee and said that these issues should be a high priority for IPCC-36

 El Gizouli (Sudan) and Nicolas Beriot (France), met to address these issues, convening twice on Friday

 The UK and Austria recommended adding a second plenary session next year in order to have enough time to respond to the IAC Review; however, after further discussion, the Panel agreed that a four-day plenary session would be preferable to two two-day plenary sessions because of both time and resource constraints

 WGII Co-Chair Vicente Barros (Argentina) highlighted a range of on-going expert, regional expert and lead author meetings, and Head of WGII TSU Kristie Ebi discussed the draft chapter writing schedule (IPCC-XXXIV/Doc

<p class="textstory">WGI Co-Chair Thomas Stocker discussed a variety of expert meetings, including a Joint Expert Meeting in Lima, Peru, on Geoengineering in June 2011; a second WGI Lead Author meeting held in Brest, France in July 2011, which engaged primarily with cross-chapter issues; and a third Lead Author WGI meeting to be held in Marrakech, Morocco in April 2012

<p class="textstory"><strong>TASK FORCE ON NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES: </strong>TFB Co-Chair Thelma Krug (Brazil) reviewed progress on the 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands (2013 Wetlands Supplement) work programme (IPCC-XXXIV/Doc

 12), and noted that a recent Lead Author meeting in Japan identified the scope and coverage of each chapter and addressed several cross-cutting and interacting issues

 Co-Chair Krug also highlighted ongoing expert meetings and the success of an open symposium hosted in Japan on 22 August 2011, which aimed to explain the purpose and achievement of the TFI to the public

 She said these included a postgraduate student from Uganda, Jamiat Nanteza, who would be working on climate-related disaster management issues

 Belgium expressed interest in the opinion of the Board of Trustees to the Programme

<p class="textstory">Also, Secretary Christ drew attention to a notification from UN Headquarters that the Republic of South Sudan was admitted as a new Member State by the UN General Assembly on 14 July 2011, and that the official name of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya had been changed to Libya (IPCC-XXXIV/INF

 South Sudan has therefore become a new member of the IPCC, bringing the total of its members to 195 countries

<p class="textstory">In his final remarks, Chair Pachauri thanked the government and people of Uganda for their hospitality and excellent organization of the meeting

 Parties agreed that notes prepared by the facilitators of the AWG-LCA informal groups be carried forward to the third part of AWG-LCA 14 in Panama

<p class="textstory">The AWG-LCA and AWG-KP reconvened from 1-7 October 2011 in Panama City, Panama

<p class="textstory">Since the negotiations in Panama, a number of meetings have been held that are relevant to Durban

<p class="textstory">COP 16 President Patricia Espinosa, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mexico, urged delegates to agree on, <em>inter alia</em>: full implementation of the Cancun Agreements; capitalizing the Green Climate Fund; and the future of the Kyoto Protocol, reaffirming the relevance of a rules-based system

<p class="textstory">Vice-President of Angola, Fernando de Piedade Dias dos Santos, representing the Southern African Development Community, stated that the Kyoto Protocol is the only suitable tool that can enable the international community to remain committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions

<p class="textstory">President of Chad, Idris Déby Itno, representing the Economic Community of Central African States, said Africa needs the resources to mitigate and adapt to climate change

<p class="textstory">Delegates observed a minute of silence to honor SBSTA Chair Mama Konaté of Mali, who had recently passed away and had been a key actor in the climate change process over many years

 PAPUA NEW GUINEA expressed concerns, suggesting that lack of agreement on voting can mean “lowest common denominator” outcomes

<p class="textstory"><strong>Adoption of the agenda:</strong> Parties agreed to proceed with their work based on the provisional agenda (FCCC/CP/2011/1) with a view to its formal adoption at a later stage following informal consultations on three agenda items proposed by India (on accelerated access to critical technologies, equitable access to sustainable development and unilateral trade measures)

 SINGAPORE expressed concerns over this procedure, noting that it could open the door to more agenda items and make the workload unmanageable

 SYRIA supported having discussions on India’s proposals

<p class="textstory"><strong>OPENING STATEMENTS</strong>: Argentina, for the G-77/CHINA, supported a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol as part of a balanced and comprehensive outcome for Durban, saying the Cancun Agreements should be fully operationalized

 PANAMA said the IMO, not the UNFCCC, is the correct forum to discuss maritime emissions

<p class="textstory">SBI Chair Robert Owen-Jones (Australia) opened the meeting and delegates adopted the agenda

<p class="textstory">In this respect, some participants were discussing media reports that Canada planned to formally withdraw from the Protocol under Article 27 by the end of the year

 Although Canada’s lack of interest in a second commitment period was widely known (along with Japan and Russia), some supporters of the Protocol seemed to feel that the timing of this latest announcement would cast a shadow in Durban

<p class="textstory">Papua New Guinea, for the COALITION FOR RAINFOREST NATIONS, called for the Green Climate Fund to include a dedicated window for REDD+ and a new market mechanism to be established and shared by both the AWG-LCA and the AWG-KP

 NORWAY said the Kyoto Protocol alone is not enough to achieve a relevant reduction of global emissions

</em> TUVALU expressed concern that some parties are asking the international community to lock into long-term, low commitments that are legally ambiguous

<p class="textstory"><strong>LULUCF (AWG-KP): </strong>Delegates discussed the way forward, with co-facilitator Marcelo Rocha (Brazil) identifying key areas for clarifying options, underscoring the group should provide technical options for a political decision

<p class="textstory"><strong>ANNEX I EMISSION REDUCTIONS (AWG-KP): </strong>In the spin-off group on numbers, co-facilitator Leon Charles (Grenada) said the week’s work should focus on, <em>inter alia</em>: the need to consider the transformation of pledges into QELROs; carryover of surplus AAUs; and whether to discuss option B (consequential amendments)

<p class="textstory"><strong>TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (AWG-LCA): </strong>Facilitator Jukka Uosukainen (Finland) recalled that parties are working under the Cancun decision contained in Paragraph 128 of 1/CP

<p class="textstory">Saudi Arabia stressed the need for text on response measures that reflects progress across all areas of the negotiations and, supported by Iraq, expressed concern that response measures have not received as much attention as mitigation under the AWG-LCA

<p class="textstory">During the AWG-LCA opening plenary on 29 November, parties agreed to: resume substantive work under the previously established informal group on enhanced action on adaptation, facilitated by Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and base discussions on the text forwarded from Panama

<p class="textstory">During informal discussions facilitated by Georg Børsting (Norway) and Suzanty Sitorus (Indonesia), parties focused on the Standing Committee of the financial mechanism of the Convention and on long-term finance

 Bolivia stressed the need for discussing intellectual property rights in the context of the TEC

<p class="textstory">During the opening AWG-LCA plenary, parties agreed to resume substantive work under the informal group on capacity building, facilitated by Maas Goote (Netherlands)

 Delegates based discussions on the text forwarded from Panama, focusing on paragraphs related to, <em>inter alia</em>: enhancing monitoring and review of the effectiveness of capacity building; and modalities regarding institutional arrangements for capacity building

<p class="textstory">Consideration of the further definition of the scope and development of the Review of the adequacy of the long-term global goal, in the light of the ultimate objective of the Convention, and the overall progress made towards achieving it, was taken up in a contact group facilitated by Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe)

 Parties considered a number of options for streamlining a non-paper referred from the last AWG-LCA meeting in Panama

 An informal group facilitated by Kunihiko Shimada (Japan) was established to address matters related to Annex I parties with economies in transition (EIT) and matters related to Annex I parties whose special circumstances are recognized by the COP

<p class="textstory">This issue was addressed in an informal group facilitated by María del Socorro Flores (Mexico)

 Bolivia said he does not “trust” voluntary pledges, and suggested a compliance system particularly in consideration of countries that are not party to the Protocol

 Australia supported a new legally-binding instrument, with specific obligations for a broad set of parties, while Palau called for a new protocol

 Japan supported a new, single, legally-binding instrument with participation of all major economies

 India, supported by China, suggested this option should be based on, and under, the UNFCCC and not involve reinterpretation or amendment of the Convention, with China suggesting that “dynamic” interpretation of the principle may entail amendment

<p class="textstory">In opening statements, Argentina, for the G-77/China, stressed the need for developed countries to put forward ambitious quantified emission reduction commitments under the AWG-KP and lamented that current pledges are insufficient

<p class="textstory">Spain reported on an informal meeting jointly organized with Mexico and South Africa to discuss the legal form of the AWG-LCA outcome

 The spin-off groups were co-facilitated by Leon Charles (Grenada) and Jürgen Lefevere (EU) and focused on: the need to consider the transformation of pledges into QELROs; carryover of surplus AAUs; and whether to discuss option B (consequential amendments)

 Submissions were made by Brazil on QELROs and by AOSIS, Brazil and the African Group on carryover of surplus AAUs

<p class="textstory"><strong>LULUCF:</strong> The issue was addressed in a spin-off group co-chaired by Peter Iversen (Denmark) and Marcelo Rocha (Brazil)

 United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said economic troubles should not distract from the ultimate goal of a binding comprehensive agreement, adding that although this objective may be unattainable at present, parties must remain ambitious and keep up the momentum for COP 18 in Qatar

<p class="textstory">Alberto Pedro D’Alotto, Argentina, on behalf of the G-77/China, described the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol as a cornerstone of efforts to address climate change, adding that non-Annex I parties also need to join these efforts with comparable commitments

 SBSTA Chair Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) and SBI Chair Robert Owen-Jones (Australia) presented an oral report of the work of the session

 The EU said in order to maintain symmetry with the outcome of the AWG-LCA, the length of the second commitment period should be from 2013-2020, instead of 2013-2017, with Brazil expressing interest in this proposal

 Grenada, Colombia and the Gambia said it is important to maintain a five-year rather than an eight-year second commitment period, given the low level of ambition

 Japan proposed a footnote identifying countries that will not take part in a second commitment period

 Bolivia observed that reference to a “25-40 percent” reduction of aggregate emissions for Annex I parties by 2020 is too wide a range, and should be identified as a single percentage

 Papua New Guinea, the Gambia, Colombia and Brazil supported the Chair’s proposal to forward the text for consideration by CMP

 Delegates continued to propose changes, and Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Bolivia requested bracketing paragraphs 3-5, which refer to the assumption of QELROs, while Kenya and Nicaragua proposed language to strengthen the paragraphs

 Venezuela called for ensuring strong language in the text to preserve the Kyoto Protocol

 Egypt expressed disappointment with the insufficient level of ambition and said the objective of strengthening the only existing legally-binding regime was not accomplished in the text

 Nicaragua said the text does not set out a process or a timeframe that could provide a solution to avoiding a gap between commitment periods

 Indonesia said many elements of the amalgamation document (FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/CRP

<p class="textstory"> India raised concerns over the inclusion of agriculture in the section on mitigation and exclusion of trade from the section on the economic and social consequences of response measures

 Pakistan regretted a lack of balance on mitigation and that the Adaptation Committee has not been given the status of a subsidiary body

 With Egypt, he expressed concern over how the text addresses long-term finance

 Bangladesh, Switzerland, the Philippines and Tanzania expressed support for the text

 China said the text does not reflect the concerns of both sides and that it should specify how the developed countries’ commitment to mobilize US$100 billion included in the Cancun Agreements will be achieved

 Bolivia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ecuador expressed concern over the unbalanced text, particularly considering developed and developing countries’ mitigation, with Bolivia saying that the text, <em>inter alia</em>: lacks a compliance system to monitor developed countries’ commitments, which is particularly relevant for those not subscribing to a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol; places excessive requirements on mitigation for developing countries; does not reflect CBDR; and favors the creation and use of markets

 Seeking to send a message that humankind can respond aggressively to climate change, Papua New Guinea suggested that the proposed decision should be forwarded as part of a balanced package

 Malaysia expressed concern about weak mitigation targets for developed countries and described a number of issues raised by developing countries that were deferred to future meetings, including equity, intellectual property rights and trade measures

 Malawi underlined the role of public finance

 Kenya listed demands for a number of improvements on: mitigation, transformation level of pledges, ambition, accounting, compliance and reporting

 Japan conceded the document was not perfect, required more ambition, but pressed for adoption

 Venezuela reported that she had received threats, implying that if her country did not agree to the adoption of the AWG-LCA text there would be no second commitment period and there would be no GCF

<p class="textstory">Emphasizing that the EU had “shown patience” and readiness to commit to a second commitment period of at least five years, the EU, supported by Chile, Norway and Colombia, called for a protocol or legal instrument under the Convention by 2018

 Cautioning against “saying goodbye to the principle of equity,” and shifting burden sharing on to developing countries, India observed that they had agreed to language expressing specific options, and that India would “never be intimidated by threats

<p class="textstory">Observing that countries “were climbing down the ladder of ambition,” Grenada called for creating a protocol or legal instrument that will hold countries accountable

 China underscored the need to implement the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and highlighted its own efforts to deal with climate change that others have not taken

 Bolivia stressed how the “right to development” is linked to emissions and how a climate regime must address this relationship

 The Philippines said that a legal regime should be designed with a view to saving the Kyoto Protocol

 Pakistan said that, despite how much the world has changed, the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities still apply

<p class="textstory">Brazil called for a legally binding agreement, observing that “we are on the verge of approving the most important result after the Berlin Mandate,” while Egypt noted the need for clarity on the predictability, sustainability, additionality and transparency of support

” India and the EU said they could support the agreed language

<p class="textstory">Bolivia, opposed by Papua New Guinea, stressed that they had proposed deleting a paragraph stipulating that any units generated from market-based mechanisms to be established under the Convention or its instruments may be used by Annex I parties to assist them in achieving compliance with their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments

 Bolivia requested his objections to be recorded in the meeting report

 Mexico congratulated the South African Government on their successful hosting of the conference

 Ecuador, for ALBA, stressed the need to move forward with certainty that Qatar will take up issues of justice and equity

 Grenada for AOSIS also expressed satisfaction with the outcome

 It was deemed essential that the EU assure China and India that they would simply be expected to turn their Cancun pledges into new legal arrangements

 The Presidency and the EU were able to lock in the relatively constructive role of countries such as Brazil

 While China seemed content to allow India to do BASIC’s heavy lifting and profile the “equity” issue, an issue—alongside common but differentiated responsibilities—that has helped define the contest over contemporary rights to development and the debate over mitigation commitments

 Described as a “defining moment,” a last-minute “huddle” on the plenary floor—perhaps the most authentic of all the Indabas—in the early hours of Sunday morning enabled the EU to reach a compromise with India on an option to describe the new UNFCCC instrument in acceptable legal terms

 It is an issue that could come back to haunt the Europeans who might well discover with the passage of time just how big a compromise they made to India, if other countries choose to construct an “escape hatch” around the legal terminology that falls short of a new protocol

 UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recalled a tragic encounter with a child in Kiribati who could not sleep soundly for fear that he would be stolen away in the night by a rising ocean

 Countries must now define strategies to deliver a global and ambitious climate treaty in four years and citizens will turn their attention to build support for action in their domestic political and economic systems as the uncertain road opens up to what some in China call an emerging “ecological civilization

 India underscored the role of agriculture for livelihoods and supported work on adaptation in the agriculture sector

<p class="textstory">Papua New Guinea said more ambition to mobilize finance is required to move faster on REDD+, and supported a REDD+ governance structure to provide guidance and standards

 Switzerland said it is not opportune to have a governing body on REDD+ at this stage under the ADP

<p class="textstory">Underscoring developed country leadership as key to enhancing ambition, China lamented that some developed countries have withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol

 China also underscored that enhanced developing country action requires finance and other forms of support, calling for the immediate operationalization of the GCF

 The Philippines expressed frustration that the ADP process has yet to deliver, calling for action instead of more roundtables

 Supported by the Marshall Islands and Singapore, he suggested political and technical dialogues, with Singapore indicating that these discussions need to interact and reinforce each other

 She supported further addressing HFCs and, with Nauru and others, fossil fuel subsidies

 Norway, supported by Nauru, suggested addressing barriers to renewable energy and energy efficiency

 Uganda highlighted the need for a strengthened institutional framework to mobilize adequate financial and human resources

 Indonesia underscored the need for: a combination of “push and pull factors” to introduce and implement national policies; and systematizing best practices and lessons learned

 Mali called for, <em>inter alia</em>, a platform through which feasibility studies on mitigation actions could be prepared <em>pro bono</em> or at low cost, so as to channel the available finance for implementation

 Mexico suggested addressing: renewable energy, REDD+, bunker fuels and ecolabeling

 He suggested: a roundtable in June to discuss efforts countries see themselves taking from 2020 in the context of national circumstances; and, supported by the EU and Norway, a roundtable on a potential consultation process to compare efforts proposed by countries and the level of mitigation ambition required by science </p> 

 Supported by Norway, the EU reiterated a step-wise approach that couples nationally-driven approaches with international coordination

 Iran reiterated that the principles and obligations in the Convention and Kyoto Protocol should be upheld and the ADP should not shift the burden of mitigation to developing countries

 Nicaragua, for ALBA, supported: an informative session on the status of the Kyoto Protocol amendment every time the ADP meets; establishment of MRV for means of implementation, and a contact group on finance

 Iran supported a workshop on technology transfer, including those related to fossil fuels

 Nigeria suggested REDD+ be considered under Workstream 2 as a means for increasing ambition

 Supported by the Philippines, South Africa opposed taking a sectoral approach, emphasizing instead the need for taking a holistic approach and to understand how the outcome of Workstream 2 relates to Workstream 1

 Switzerland, for the EIG, welcomed the convergence emerging at ADP 2, and invited delegates to work on specific thematic areas, including climate finance, renewable energy and energy efficiency

<p class="textstory">Norway emphasized that the EU and Norway have been implementing the amendment to the Kyoto Protocol since 1 January 2013, and invited other countries to proceed to ratification

<p class="textstory">Papua New Guinea emphasized that REDD+ is more mature than other elements under discussion, and identified the need to quantify its potential in helping filling the pre-2020 gap

<p align="center" class="textstory"><em>Katarzyna Snyder, Poland, Incoming COP 19 Presidency</em></p> 

<p class="textstory">At the last CMP meeting in Doha, Qatar, in 2012, an amendment was adopted to the Kyoto Protocol creating a second commitment period that commits Annex I parties to an average 18% reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by 2020

 Moreover, as the exchanges between Brazil and Norway demonstrated, some fear that developed countries’ support for actions in third countries may lead to avoidance of national mitigation efforts in other sectors

<p class="textstory">The opening plenary of the second part of ADP 2 took place on 4 June with Jayant Moreshver Mauskar (India) and Harald Dovland (Norway) continuing as Co-Chairs

<p class="textstory"><strong>ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS: Election of officers:</strong> At the ADP closing plenary on 13 June, Co-Chair Mauskar announced Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and Artur Runge-Metzger (EU) as the incoming ADP Co-Chairs and Isabel Di Carlo Quero (Venezuela) as the new Rapporteur

<p class="textstory">On <strong><em>proposals for the 2015 agreement</em></strong>, Bangladesh said the agreement must be: applicable to all; rules-based; predictable, robust, clear, enforceable and scientifically-sound; and take into account long-term perspectives, CBDR and equity, and loss and damage

 Switzerland proposed a hybrid approach to burden sharing, including: common rules and expectations; a consultative phase; and a common MRV system

 Australia elaborated on the design of a spectrum of commitments and highlighted the benefits of a hybrid approach, which would enable parties to take ownership of their bottom-up nationally determined commitment and robust internationally-agreed rules

 Ethiopia proposed a hybrid approach based on, <em>inter alia</em>: historical and per capita emissions; the global temperature goal; quantified and apportioned atmospheric space; and quantified emission rights

 Mexico highlighted the need to identify areas for improvement and the link between efficient and transparent application of rules and their ability to impact the attainment of goals

 Brazil explained that the proposal, originally made in 1997, addresses historical responsibility not just in terms of emissions, but also in terms of relative historical contributions to the temperature increase

<p class="textstory">On <strong><em>transparency, accountability and support for actions</em></strong>,Mali called for a rules-based regime equipped with international review systems and a compliance mechanism with facilitative and enforcement functions, and suggested that the Standing Committee on Finance coordinate an international mechanism for MRV of support

 Australia, supported by New Zealand, Norway, the US and Japan, stressed the importance of <em>ex ante</em> and <em>ex post</em> transparency and accountability, emphasizing the need for: providing clarity to predict and quantify the impacts of parties’ commitments; understanding the methods used by parties to track their efforts; and tracking impacts and learning lessons to enhance actions

<p class="textstory"> On <strong><em>finance, technology and capacity building</em></strong>, Norway said support would always be forthcoming if it resulted in action

 India called for provision of concessional technology to allow developing countries to take early and effective action

 China proposed considering a mechanism for technology transfer

 Peru drew attention to early action to avoid a steep rise in adaptation costs

 Nepal underscored means of implementation for developing countries to deal with vulnerabilities and undertake a low-carbon development path

 Nauru highlighted, <em>inter alia</em>, identification of sources, and scaling up provision, of climate finance

 Japan suggested that consideration of capacity building, technology transfer and finance in the 2015 agreement build on existing arrangements and discussions

 The Philippines cautioned against applying the notion of respective capabilities to developed countries’ commitments

 Switzerland underscored the need for a strong enabling environment, a blend of public and private sources, and domestic and multilateral finance for a low-carbon future

 India stressed the need to establish linkages between Workstreams 1 and 2, and to consider how the work of the SBs, the IPCC and the 2013-15 Review will inform the 2015 agreement

 Switzerland stressed the need to link the new agreement with: the scientific reality, looking beyond fossil fuel emissions; and political realities, looking forward beyond adaptation and public funding

 Switzerland urged that all “should commit to commit” in a COP 19 decision on mitigation

 The Philippines, for the LMDC, and Saudi Arabia called for a focused process structured around the four pillars of the Convention

 Singapore highlighted areas for further work, including: the leadership role of developed countries; how to enhance implementation; how to clarify actions put forward by parties; and how to ensure that the rules facilitate universal participation

 Nauru, for AOSIS, highlighted means of implementation and called for further work on linkages between existing institutions

 Indonesia highlighted the need to understand opportunities and costs to catalyze action at the national level and how actions should be allocated among parties

 Nepal, for LDCs, warned that international cooperative initiatives cannot replace mid- and long-term commitments

<p class="textstory">On <strong><em>enhancing finance, technology and capacity building</em></strong><em>,</em> China underlined gaps in: mitigation; adaptation; equitable access to sustainable development based on historical responsibilities; and support to developing countries

 Uganda observed that adjustments towards low-carbon development need to begin with informed policies, while also maintaining the development objectives of developing countries

 Venezuela noted the need to transform unsustainable lifestyles and cautioned against leaving policy setting to the markets

 Indonesia highlighted the importance of considering enabling environments in developed countries and at the global level to mobilize finance and technology

<p class="textstory">Venezuela, for LMDC, supported by Mauritius, emphasized that developed countries’ emission reductions should be based on domestic actions and called for delivery of means of implementation

 Brazil agreed with the need for structural changes in the economy and for low-carbon investment choices, but underscored that developed countries need to take the lead

<p class="textstory"> On <strong><em>the way forward to COP 19</em></strong>, Nauru, for AOSIS, supported by Nepal, Indonesia and Kenya, proposed: submissions, including on energy policies and technologies with emphasis on the scale of emission reductions, barriers and strategies to overcome those barriers; a technical paper compiling parties’ submissions on specific problems they face, with corresponding solutions from technical expert meetings; a technical workshop; and a ministerial roundtable at COP 19

 The Philippines suggested broadening the proposal to also cover adaptation

 Venezuela said it would be more useful to discuss “normative trends,” pilot practices and means to facilitate a paradigm shift

 Mali, for the African Group, said parties should not focus on a particular option or sector and called for: a process to review support from Annex I parties; clarity on the delivery of the US$100 billion of annual long-term finance; and options to strengthen the price of carbon

 Switzerland, the Federated States of Micronesia, the EU and others identified the need to address HFCs also under the Montreal Protocol, while Venezuela, for the LMDC, opposed, indicating that the issue relates to GHGs and should therefore be considered only under the UNFCCC

 Australia highlighted the energy sector as an area warranting technical work, while India, with Argentina, indicated that a technical paper on raising mitigation ambition and sectoral issues would be premature without clarity on which sectoral issues should be addressed

 Malaysia stated that with means of implementation, more could be accomplished by developing countries

 Bangladesh stressed the need to reduce gaps and raise ambition in adaptation, finance, technology transfer and capacity building

 Brazil indicated that the GCF is “not at the level we expected” and Iran highlighted paragraph 26 of the Rio+20 outcome document on countries refraining from unilateral economic, financial or trade measures violating international law

 Australia called pledges “critical,” he said more work is required on conditions to encourage more pledges and enhance the existing ones

<p class="textstory">On Workstream 1, Australia, for the Umbrella Group, called for, <em>inter alia</em>, up-front transparency measures to ensure predictability of commitments and a consultative process to consider ambition and fairness

 Papua New Guinea, for the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, underlined the potential of REDD+ to contribute to closing the mitigation gap with new and additional financial and technical support

 Uganda reminded parties that there are 930 days left to negotiate the 2015 agreement and called for a move toward negotiating text

 Bangladesh called for proposals on how specific rules should be applied to adaptation under a rules-based multilateral system, while Mexico expressed interest in including HFCs under Workstream 2

 The Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine proposed to add an agenda item on procedural and legal matters relating to decision-making under the COP and CMP

<p class="textstory">While knowing that a discussion on decision-making procedures will not be an easy one, most parties agree that issues raised by the Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine are valid

 A related proposal from Papua New Guinea and Mexico to amend the Convention in order to allow voting in situations where a consensus cannot be reached is in fact already on the COP agenda

 As Singapore put it, if we accept this proposal “every party will have every incentive to add additional agenda items at every meeting of the UNFCCC,” going on to caution that “how we resolve this impasse will set a precedent for the future

” In her closing press conference, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres noted that parties all agreed on the need to discuss the issue highlighted by Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, but could not agree on how to do it

 While acknowledging shortcomings in the UNFCCC decision-making process, Tuvalu pointed to the “supreme irony, of using procedure to make the process even worse,” which he described as “deliberately crashing a car to show that the seatbelts don’t work

 Many feel that since the proposal by Belarus, Russia and Ukraine relates to decision-making by the COP and CMP, it should be considered by these bodies and not the SBI

 In Bonn, India, the Philippines and Argentina articulated the concerns of many developing countries that a cap on emissions in agriculture would threaten the livelihoods of many and maintained that food security should not be relegated to mitigation objectives

<p class="textstory"><strong>IPCC-34:</strong> The meeting, held from 18-19 November 2011 in Kampala, Uganda, focused on follow-up actions to the IAC Review of the IPCC processes and procedures, namely in relation to procedures, COI policy, and communications strategy

<p class="textstory"><strong>IPCC-35: </strong>This session took place from 6-9 June 2012 in Geneva, Switzerland

<p class="textstory">On Monday morning, WGI Co-Chair Thomas Stocker (Switzerland) opened the session

 WGI Co-Chair Qin Dahe (China) said that the latest findings collected in AR5 reflect the most recent understanding of climate change and will be used as a major scientific basis for policy making by governments

<p class="textstory">Lena Ek, Minister for the Environment, Sweden, welcomed participants, recalling the 40th anniversary of the International Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm celebrated in 2012

 Australia suggested deleting “past and future,” and others agreed

 The addition of “scientific assumptions” was supported by Brazil and opposed by Austria, Canada, Germany and Belgium

<p class="textstory">Germany, Australia, Chile, Spain, Fiji, New Zealand, the US, Saint Lucia, Tanzania, Mexico, Slovenia, the UK and others supported the statement as presented, with Germany pointing out that AR4 concluded almost the same

 Canada pointed out that factors other than warming will be the emphasis in the future

<p class="textstory"><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Addressing the keynote statement to the sub-section, Germany, supported by Belgium and Ireland, argued for an opening sentence singling out the fact that the first decade of the 21st century has been the warmest decade since 1850

 Canada proposed adding the word “successively” for the sentence to read that: “Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preceding decade since 1850

” This language was supported by the CLAs, Slovenia, the US, Austria, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Trinidad and Tobago, and eventually accepted

<p class="textstory">On temperature change between 1850-1900 and 1986-2005, Canada, supported by Belgium and the US, proposed providing context for the two time periods, referring to the former as the early instrumental period, and the latter as the AR5 reference period used for projections

<p class="textstory">Germany, supported by Belgium, Luxembourg and others, suggested adding that the rates of warming were higher in the preceding 15-year period

 Norway noted that only periods of 30 years are sufficient to draw conclusions about rates of temperature change as defined in the glossary of the report

 The US, with Belgium, Luxembourg and others, proposed adding that the rate of warming since the late 1990s is very sensitive to the choice of a start year, referring to a strong El Niño effect in 1997-1998

<p class="textstory">The US, with Brazil, further suggested adding actual estimates of the rate of warming for 15-year periods using different starting years, to which a CLA responded that this was not evaluated in the underlying assessment

<p class="textstory">Concerning text on the Medieval Climate Anomaly, Belgium and Ireland underscored that this phenomenon was regional in nature, unlike global warming in late 20th century, and suggested clarifying language to reflect this

 Canada, supported by Norway, raised the issue of the Arctic experiencing a greater increase in surface temperature than globally, and text on this was introduced in other parts of the SPM

 Guinea, Tanzania, Madagascar, Malawi, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and the Philippines highlighted the need to mention the Southern Hemisphere as well, since precipitation is an important issue for policy makers there

 Mali underlined the importance of rain-based agriculture; Ethiopia highlighted droughts and floods that have occurred due to precipitation variability; and the Comoros stressed the special vulnerability of island states

<p class="textstory">On the global mean sea level rise during the last interglacial period (129,000 to 116,000 years ago), the UK, Austria, US, Germany and others supported providing a policy relevant context and linking paleoclimatic observations on sea level rise to temperature

 To avoid confusing policy makers, China and Japan opposed causally linking sea level rise to specific temperature levels, explaining that mechanisms affecting sea level rise in pre-industrial times were different

<p class="textstory"><strong>Carbon and Other Biochemical Cycles: </strong>On the headline statement in this section, Brazil insisted on nuancing the relative contribution of land-use change to the increase of CO2 concentrations, and including reference to the role of forests as sinks, with Venezuela proposing to refer to the net balance between emissions and carbon capture by land systems

 The US suggested adding terrestrial sinks, and mentioning that the increase in CO2 concentrations is “secondarily” from land use change, while Norway stated that it would not be appropriate to mention terrestrial sinks here

 Saudi Arabia and Venezuela underlined the importance of referring, in the headline statement, to all three GHGs, namely CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide

 Many delegates attempted to clarify and simplify language, while Argentina urged participants to “save energy for more controversial chapters

 DRIVERS OF CLIMATE CHANGE:</strong> This section was taken up in plenary on Wednesday when a contact group was formed, co-chaired by Arthur Rolle (Bahamas) and Jean-Pascal van Ypersele (Belgium)

 The US, Austria, Saudi Arabia, the Russian Federation, Germany, Belgium and others supported reference to 10-15-year periods in general

 China maintained that reference should only be made to the past 15 years

 Informal consultations did not result in agreement, and the Co-Chair proposed, and China accepted, a compromise to include in parenthesis “e

 Germany questioned the adequacy of that language

<p class="textstory">On Thursday morning, Germany and the UK said that their objections were not noted the previous evening when a sentence on overestimates in some models introduced by Saudi Arabia was adopted

 Saudi Arabia, supported by Sudan, expressed grave concerns in opening up agreed text, emphasizing that “we are in dangerous waters,” while Sudan added that opening up agreed text raises the issue of equal treatment of countries

<p class="textstory"><strong>Quantification of Climate System Responses: </strong>On equilibrium climate sensitivity, several delegations, including Australia, the Netherlands and others, noted that the message that the lower limit of the assessed “likely” range of climate sensitivity is less than the 2°C in the AR4 can be confusing to policy makers and suggested noting it is the same as in previous assessments

<p class="textstory">On GHG metrics, the text was endorsed by Austria, the Netherlands, Slovenia and New Zealand, and opposed by Brazil, who called for informal consultations, explaining this was one of the most important issues in AR5 for his delegation due to different policy implications of the choice between Global Warming Potential and Global Temperature Potential as a metric

 This was supported, with several different wording suggestions, by Slovenia, Switzerland, Canada, Fiji, Saint Lucia and Germany, and opposed by Saudi Arabia

 China suggested changing “pre-industrial” to “1850-1900,” while the EU and Belgium underscored that “pre-industrial” is an important word used by policy makers

 The US and Canada suggested solving the issue by adding language on using 1850-1900 as a proxy for “pre-industrial

 Sweden and the UK asked why only the RCP8

 Noting more frequent and extreme rainfall in the Sahel, Mali asked why dry regions were not mentioned, to which the CLAs responded that, because of natural variability, the same statement could not be made for dry regions

 Many delegates, including Canada, Norway, UK, France, Japan, the Russian Federation, Denmark and Slovenia, engaged with the CLAs in drafting more precise language that would less likely be interpreted as “alarmist

<p class="textstory"><strong>Sea Level: </strong>On the basis for higher projections of global mean sea level rise in the 21st century, Germany queried why an upper boundary “of what is physically possible” has not been indicated, to which the CLAs responded that there was no scientific basis for providing this information since there were no probability levels available

<p class="textstory"><strong>Carbon and Other Biochemical Cycles: </strong>On cumulative fossil fuel emissions for the 2012-2100 period, China, Kenya and Venezuela, opposed by Germany, said presenting figures for the means together with the ranges created confusion

 An informal consultation group was established, which was later transformed into a formal contact group, co-chaired by Nicolas Beriot (France) and Elisabeth Holland (Fiji)

6 requires by 2050 an average emission reduction of 50% relative to 1990, Germany, supported by Slovenia and Belgium, proposed adding figures for beyond 2050, for example for 2080

 China stressed that it has the same concerns here as on the discussion on cumulative fossil fuel emissions and suggested inserting information on all RCPs

<p class="textstory"><strong>Climate Stabilization, Climate Change Commitment and Irreversibility: </strong>On the relationship between cumulative total emissions of CO2 and global mean surface temperature change, China, Saudi Arabia and India expressed difficulties understanding that this relationship is linear, with China, supported by Saudi Arabia, suggesting referring to “positively correlated” instead of “approximately linear

” The UK and Ireland expressed support for the original text

 China and the US, supported by Saudi Arabia, suggested referring to “level” or “range” instead of “target” for warming and emissions

 Japan questioned use of “likely,” with the CLAs suggesting to qualify it with reference to a probability of 66% or more

<p class="textstory">The Republic of Korea opposed reference to the “Sea of Japan” in the underlying assessment, noting that the issue is contested and that the IPCC language should remain neutral, while Japan said “Sea of Japan” is a standard geographical term

 IPCC Chair Pachauri assured that the remarks and concerns of the Republic of Korea and Japan have been recorded, noting that the issue goes beyond the Panel’s competence

 Finland requested a session with coordinating lead authors (CLAs) to address substantive questions on the emission factors for boreal drained forest land in Chapter 2 (Drained Inland Organic Soils)

<p class="textstory">The Netherlands and the US raised concerns about the large difference in emission factors between different tropical forest plantations

<p class="textstory">On the section on Coverage of the Wetlands Supplements, the Chapter 3 CLA clarified in response to a question from Russia that, given the many purposes for which land is rewetted and the lack of literature on each of the purposes, the emission factors cover all purposes for which wet soil can be rewetted

<p class="textstory">China and Germany raised concerns about aspects of the methodology for estimation and reporting on constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment (Chapter 6)

 China stated that these methodologies require further development and should be placed in annexes

<p class="textstory">Co-Chair Krug also reported on issues related to Chapter 4 (Coastal Wetlands), saying that concerns raised by China regarding fish ponds were resolved by including an explanation on how the emission factors were derived, and by ensuring consistency with the treatment of animals addressed in the agricultural sector

<p class="textstory">Many parties, including Germany, Finland, the US, China, Norway and Mali, expressed satisfaction with the hard work and constructive spirit of the small working groups in finding solutions, saying the amendments improve the applicability of the Supplement

 On accounting for harvested wood products, China requested, and the Panel agreed to, clear language stating that, in accordance with Decision 2/CMP

<p class="textstory">On the Policy Relevance section of the chapter, Germany, Spain, India and Finland, opposed by Brazil, objected to a sentence related to the starting date for the definition of reforestation, which stated that a different interpretation may be a possible subject of future decisions of the international climate change regime

 Finland highlighted the importance of the IPCC for small and developing countries and noted the need for both continuity and regular change on the Bureau

 Mali urged the identification of gaps, highlighting the need for a special team to address inadequate data availability, processing and treatment, especially in Africa

 Mexico, supported by Venezuela, called for involving rural and indigenous communities and for including traditional knowledge

 Sweden, the Netherlands, New Zealand and others referred to the need to adapt to the changing times, but underscored the importance of maintaining the IPCC’s rigorous processes

 Norway stressed the need for involvement of the Bureau

 In the discussions, Canada stressed the importance of maintaining policy relevance and scientific integrity and called for incorporating inputs from organizations such as the UNFCCC, World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), as well as business and others, in an open and transparent process when discussing the future of the IPCC

 Japan supported continuation of the work on methodological guidance undertaken by the TFI, especially in light of a UNFCCC agreement in 2015, and said it would continue to support the TFI’s activities

 Supported by Saudi Arabia, Indonesia also stressed the importance for the IPCC to benefit from international progress in sustainable development discussions

 China emphasized keeping in mind the needs of the UNFCCC and governments, enhancing the visibility of the IPCC and its products, and called for consistency between a sixth assessment report and the AR4 and AR5

 Argentina underlined the importance of creating incentives for the CLAs to ensure their continued involvement in the WGs, and said availability of special reports should be increased

<p class="textstory">Stressing the importance of supporting work on adaptation, Nicaragua emphasized the need for more representative data for each region, a greater focus on loss and damage issues, more regional experts and improved developing country capacities to process data

 Maldives, with Peru, highlighted the need for synthesizing country submissions on the future of the IPCC

 Tanzania urged efforts to enhance involvement of African scientists and underlined the need for communication and outreach

 Madagascar urged the development of a procedure for consulting and getting inputs from users of IPCC reports, suggested more awareness raising, and asked for increased training of African scientists so that more regional data can be used in IPCC assessments

<p class="textstory">Addressing a process and timeline for a task group, Germany suggested holding back-to-back meetings with already scheduled sessions in 2014, including possibly IPCC-39 in Berlin, and for a decision in early 2015 to allow for the election of the Bureau, six months later

 Given fundamental changes in the global economy since 1992, some non-Annex I countries, such as the Republic of Korea, China, Brazil and India, are now economic powerhouses with associated increases in GHG emissions

 Today, China, the world’s largest emitter in absolute terms, also ranks on par with the EU in per capita terms, prompting those open to differentiation to note the need for the 2015 agreement to look at current and future emissions as those will amount to tomorrow’s historical responsibilities

 Only four countries—Bangladesh, Barbados, Mauritius and the United Arab Emirates—have ratified the Doha Amendment, which needs 144 ratifications to enter into force

 Norway and the EU underlined the need for common rules on the use of carbon markets

 Bangladesh called for a robust MRV framework and the assessment of <em>ex ante</em> information

 Turkey said the framework should have a degree of flexibility and avoid applying all rules to all parties in all circumstances, as this would delay action

 Chile called for a unified MRV system for action and support, differentiated based on capability

<p class="textstory">On <strong><em>markets</em></strong>, Japan called for avoiding double counting when using market mechanisms

<p class="textstory">The LDCs and the Philippines called for a definition of <strong><em>climate finance</em></strong>

 Ecuador recalled their submission on transparency of climate finance, stressing only funds that are entirely aimed at addressing climate change should be counted towards obligations on climate finance, while leveraged funds would be considered complementary

 Papua New Guinea called for mainstreaming climate change in the global economy and for putting a price on carbon and promoting innovative public-private partnerships

<p class="textstory">AILAC and Brazil expressed concern on overreliance on market mechanisms to achieve the climate goal

 Turkey underlined the need for these measures to ensure enhanced mitigation, environmental integrity, and incentives for the private sector, as well as avoid fragmentation

<p class="textstory">On a <strong><em>compliance mechanism</em></strong>, China said discussion of a compliance mechanism is premature

<p class="textstory">Stressing the importance of compliance, Bangladesh warned against introducing so much flexibility into the legally binding agreement that it becomes “a gentlemen’s agreement

<p class="textstory">On <strong><em>response measures</em></strong>, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran called for addressing the economic and social consequences of response measures in the new agreement

 Turkey highlighted the trade effects of response measures

 Iran called for referencing the obligations of developed countries on MOI

</strong> On the caption for the figure, Bolivia, supported by Saudi Arabia, recommended qualifying development as “sustainable” and queried the meaning of “governance

<p class="textstory">Bolivia and Nicaragua stressed that the caption’s text should take a cosmo-centric rather than an anthropocentric approach and include reference to the vulnerability and exposure of Mother Earth

 Venezuela said that Mother Earth is a universal UN concept and could be included in the SPM

 Panama suggested using the term “socio-ecological systems” to address this concern

 Mexico said the impacts of human and natural systems on development must be highlighted

 Canada, supported by Austria, opposed reference to Mother Earth in the operative text

<p class="textstory">Norway, supported by Panama, suggested that the text state that climate-related risk and impacts result from the interaction of hazards with vulnerability and exposure

 Austria, with Canada and Saudi Arabia, said that risk does not always become an impact

 Switzerland explained that everything that influences the climate is an impact, and risks are impacts with an uncertain outcome that can sometimes be quantified

1: Illustration of the Core Concepts of the WGII AR5, </strong>the UK, supported by Canada, proposed that the figure include an arrow showing a feedback loop indicating that impacts are integral to the climate change system

 Canada stated that emissions are not the only source of climate change, urging inclusion of an arrow showing the role of land-use change

 Austria suggested using the term “human systems

 For the first sentence of the SPM Introduction, stating that human interference with the climate system is occurring and climate change poses risks for human and natural systems, Norway called for linking human interference to the risks posed by climate change

 Canada, with the US, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Austria, opposed this, noting that the report covers more than just anthropogenic climate change

 Slovenia and the Russian Federation suggested specifying climate change as a “consequence” or “resulting from” human interference

 Bolivia called for including reference to “Mother Earth

” India suggested replacing “natural systems” with “ecosystems,” while Norway called for, and participants agreed to “natural systems,” as it is broader

 China proposed placing adaptation before mitigation, noting current negative impacts are more urgent

 The UK, supported by Italy, suggested language on reducing risks “locally through adaptation and globally through mitigation,” emphasizing that these processes reduce risk in different ways

” India, opposed by Switzerland, Bolivia, France, Australia and others, proposed deleting reference to limits to adaptation

 Germany proposed alternative language “recognizing that some risks of adverse effects are unavoidable

” Bolivia proposed inserting reference to loss and damage further undermining adaptation

 Austria warned that a statement specifying limits to adaptation might suggest that there are no limits to mitigation

 A number of delegates, including South Africa, Chile, France and Luxembourg, stressed that WGIII was the more appropriate place to address mitigation

 Bolivia stressed the need to focus on impacts

 The UK, supported by Switzerland, said the sentence should focus on providing a decision-making framework to support decisions on climate change

 Canada, supported by Saudi Arabia, queried whether the proposed change would provide value for decision makers and policy-makers

 Canada and Australia stressed that many relevant decisions will be made in non-climate change-related policy situations

 Tanzania said language referring to a focus on risk as being “new” to the assessment was confusing, and should be removed

 Switzerland called for language stating that a focus on risks can inform decision making on adaptation

<p class="textstory">Regarding a sentence on the diversity of values, Bolivia questioned the need for this issue as it is addressed elsewhere in the report, but noted that if it were included, it should focus on taking into account different visions and approaches

 Switzerland, supported by Austria stressed its importance, underlining the need for adaptation to take account of different values and not be policy prescriptive

” China and Argentina supported the term “developing countries

 Austria expressed concern that this formulation did not reflect the gaps in authorship of climate change publications

 Canada proposed stating that “authorship of climate change publications has increased, but authors from developed countries are over-represented

 Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador stressed the need to take into account governments’ comments and called for a registry with all suggestions, even if not agreed, to be officially published as an annex

 Bolivia also said that his country did not recognize the concept of “environmental services” since it is linked to a certain view of nature promoting commodification, and suggested referring to “environmental functions” instead

 He added that the term “transformation” was unacceptable as it undermines a country’s sovereignty and, supported by Venezuela, called for deleting reference to transformation throughout the SPM and draft report

 Venezuela called for referring to adaptation commitments under the UNFCCC throughout the SPM as part of the overall conceptual framework

 Austria recommended avoiding political debates that should take place under the UNFCCC and, with Switzerland and Australia, appealed to participants to respect what is presented in the scientific literature

 Niger called for agreeing to terms already defined in the underlying report

<p class="textstory">On the definition of <strong><em>climate change,</em></strong> Brazil questioned the need to include reference to land use

 Bolivia called for changes in the definition of climate change to reflect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and historical responsibility

 Venezuela questioned the exclusion of certain terms from the SPM, such as climate extremes, extreme climate phenomena, extreme events and climate shocks

<p class="textstory">Participants agreed to add the definition of <strong><em>hazard </em></strong>as stated in the Glossary, with the addition of a reference to ecosystems, as proposed by Norway, and some minor editorial changes

<p class="textstory">On the definition of <strong><em>exposure</em></strong>, Bolivia requested, and participants agreed, to include “environmental functions” alongside “environmental services” as things that can be adversely affected

 Saudi Arabia, opposed by Switzerland and Australia, proposed referring to “situations” instead of, or as well as, “places

<p class="textstory">On <strong><em>vulnerability</em></strong>, Mexico requested that “propensity” and “predisposition” to be adversely affected be specified

 With regard to vulnerability encompassing a variety of “concepts,” Switzerland, supported by Costa Rica and opposed by Saudi Arabia, requested that “concepts” be replaced with “elements

<p class="textstory">On <strong><em>impacts</em></strong>, Bolivia raised concern regarding language on the effect of impacts, stating that economic, social and cultural issues should not be described as “assets

” Switzerland suggested revisions allowing “assets” to be removed, which was agreed by the Group

 Venezuela suggested deleting a reference to “environmental services

” Norway suggested that if the term “environmental services” was deleted in this paragraph, it should be kept in the Glossary

<p class="textstory">On <strong><em>risk</em></strong>, Indonesia questioned language referring to the “potential for consequences where something of human value (including humans themselves) is at stake,” stating that the reference to “human value” was too narrow and should be expanded to include “ecological value” as well

 The US, opposed by Bolivia, suggested removing reference to “human” and leaving it as simply “values”

” Germany called for a better link between the definition of risk and the concept of risk in Figure SPM

 Canada, supported by Germany and Norway, suggested stating that risk is often represented as the probability of “exposure to a hazard,” multiplied by the “impacts” if these events occur

 Norway recommended referring to the impact of both hazardous events and “trends

” Participants agreed to language combining proposals from Canada and Australia, adding that risk is a “function of vulnerability, exposure and hazard

” Saudi Arabia, opposed by Austria, reminded participants that the report does not only assess climate change impacts

 Germany asked for clarification that assessment is “based on objective criteria and expert judgment

” Austria suggested putting this information in the caption for Figure SPM

<p class="textstory">On <strong><em>adaptation</em></strong>, Mexico proposed language on capacity building for adaptation and specified the multiple scales at which adaptation occurs, including local, national and individual levels

 On adaptation moderating harm, Slovenia proposed, and participants agreed, to add that adaptation also seeks to avoid harm

<p class="textstory">On <strong><em>transformation</em></strong>, Bolivia reiterated its call to delete all references to this term in the SPM, noting it is a complex and ambiguous topic, with normative and prescriptive aspects

 Austria underscored that the underlying literature includes multiple references to transformation, which he said is not prescriptive since countries decide on any transformations they may wish to make

 Norway and the UK supported including the definition

 The Philippines suggested deleting a sentence listing specific systems and structures where transformation can occur, noting this is of greater relevance to developed countries with greater resources

 Bolivia and Venezuela said the entire definition should be deleted since the first sentence referring to altering paradigms reflected a “colonial vision of science

 Observed Impacts, Vulnerability and Exposure:</strong> On a paragraph regarding the impacts of climate change on natural and human systems, the UK, supported by the US, requested that attribution of some impacts on human systems to climate change “beyond the influence of non-climatic drivers” be described as “distinguishable from other causes,” whereas Austria and Belgium preferred the original text

 Australia cautioned against implying that some impacts may be solely attributable to climate change

<p class="textstory">Regarding a sentence on attribution of observed impacts linking responses of natural and human systems to climate change, Austria supported a Canadian proposal reflecting that observed climate change includes anthropogenic and natural change

 The US called for specific reference to “anthropogenic” climate change and, with Belgium and the Netherlands and others, supported reference to WGI’s assessment of human influence on the climate system, to distinguish it from WGII’s emphasis on responses to climate change

 Saudi Arabia, supported by Canada, the US and the Russian Federation, noted that, in contrast to WGI’s focus, WGII links responses of natural and human systems to observed climate change “regardless of its cause,” not just anthropogenic climate change

 Australia, opposed by Chile, called for language clarifying that climate change is not just anthropogenic

 Canada said the SYR was the appropriate place to contrast the WG reports

 Regarding a sentence on how attribution is considered in WGI, Canada proposed stating that WGI quantifies the link “between observed climate change and external drivers, including human activities

<p class="textstory">The UK, supported by Finland, Norway, the European Union (EU) and Canada, stressed the need to include in a footnote a quote from the WGI report on attribution to human causes

 Japan, Luxembourg, Republic of Congo, Sweden and others called for referring to water quality as well

” Slovenia, opposed by Japan and China, suggested “availability” instead of quantity

 Norway, Mali and the Cook Islands preferred a more general reference to water resources

 India proposed referring to “the whole water cycle,” while Ghana and Saint Lucia suggested adding reference to pattern changes

 France proposed, and participants agreed, to refer to “affecting water resources in terms of quality and quantity

<p class="textstory">In the following sentence stating that climate change has caused“permafrost warming and thawing in high-latitude and in high-elevation regions,” Slovenia suggested, and participants agreed to, language reflecting that the warming and thawing are still occurring

 In response to a question by Austria regarding the confidence level of this statement, authors proposed, and participants agreed, to add “high confidence” to the text

 Several countries, including Germany, Austria, the UK and Switzerland, queried why earlier mention of increased tree mortality had been deleted

 Costa Rica, opposed by Spain and Panama, favored deleting an example of extinction of many species of Central American amphibians

 Switzerland, supported by Australia, suggested clarifying that “only a small fraction of observed species extinctions have been attributed to climate change

” Questions were also raised by: the US on the number of years that species extinctions have been taking place; Japan on whether a reference to species included terrestrial as well as marine species; Switzerland on whether “ecosystem shift” includes ecosystem change, space displacement only, or, as suggested by Tanzania, temporal shifts; Canada on whether extinction rates have actually changed; and Tanzania on the level of confidence of this finding

<p class="textstory">A figure intended to show tree mortality and forest dieback caused by drought and heat was opposed by Sudan and Tanzania

 Recognizing the potential for misinterpretation, Germany, Norway, Bolivia, Peru, Co-Chair Field and the CLA proposed various editorial changes to the caption and title, which Tanzania found acceptable

 Noting the lack of delegates from African countries present in the room, Sudan called for deletion of the figure, to which participants agreed

 On text on the impacts of climate-related extremes, Bolivia called for inserting a sentence stating that “there is evidence suggesting that loss and damage will occur from climate change despite efforts at adaptation

 On the impacts of climate-related hazards on livelihoods, Bolivia suggested adding a reference to food security, which a CLA stated is already implicit in the existing language

 On the role of violent conflict in harming assets that facilitate adaptation, Bolivia asked, and participants agreed, to replace “natural capital” with “natural resources

 Tanzania, with South Africa, Ghana and the Gambia, expressed concern that coastal erosion and impacts on marine ecosystems, including coral bleaching, were not included in the figure for Africa

” The UK said this would change the meaning and, with Austria, favored the original language

 Germany, with Belgium and New Zealand, proposed deleting the sentence

 On a sentence on most evaluations of adaptation restricted to impacts, vulnerability and adaptation planning, Canada queried the term “evaluations

 The UK, supported by France, proposed referring to adaptation projects or programmes, but the CLAs recommended retaining the original broader formulation

4: Observed and Projected Changes in Annual Average Surface Temperature</strong>, Canada and the US favored using a similar figure from the WGI report

 As an alternative, Canada, supported by the US, called for adjusting the color bar to eliminate sharp steps at 2 and 4°C and extending it to illustrate warming in the Arctic

 FUTURE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADAPTATION: </strong>On a sentence in the introductory paragraph noting that the section points to opportunities for managing risks through adaptation and mitigation, the US, supported by Canada, Ireland, India, the EU and Saudi Arabia, suggested that it should also refer to “reducing risks,” which was agreed to by the Group

 Key Risks across Sectors and Regions: </strong>In the introductory paragraph, Canada, opposed by Germany, Slovenia, Switzerland, Brazil and others, said key risks are not described in UNFCCC Article 2 on dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, and should not be linked in this paragraph to that article

<p class="textstory">On the paragraph on the risks of climate change that warrant consideration, Germany expressed concern with the ordering and weighting of the key risks in the paragraph, and India expressed concern with the timing of impacts

 Regarding a sentence noting that “expert judgments” were used in identifying key risks, Switzerland, opposed by the US, Austria and Germany, recommended deleting the term “expert judgments,” noting it diminishes credibility

” Germany proposed language stating: “Determination of which risks are key was based on expert judgment using the following specific criteria

” Japan, Tanzania and others made proposals to qualify the criteria

 Canada stated that the criteria have already been applied by the authors and cannot be changed

 Brazil, the Philippines, the EU and Australia supported this

 Australia also emphasized risks for small islands within other states

 Saint Lucia, the Maldives, Tuvalu, China, Cuba and others supported retaining “small island developing states

” Austria, supported by Mexico, Ireland, Switzerland, Saint Lucia, the US and others, proposed referring to “small island developing states and other small islands

<p class="textstory">Chad, Mali, South Sudan, Sudan, Senegal and others, opposed by Australia and Germany, supported reference to least developed countries (LDCs)

 Mali, supported by Niger, proposed “other vulnerable areas” as compromise text to cover LDCs

 Canada and the CLAs cautioned against adding new risks to the list as it might compromise scientific findings

 Australia suggested adding “vulnerable groups

<p class="textstory">South Sudan clarified that the increased vulnerability of LDCs is not due to development status, but rather to a lack of resources

 Canada emphasized that exposure levels may not depend on development status

 Kenya stated that risks to coastal zones, for example, cover all countries irrespective of development status

 South Sudan said damage to, and destruction of, property should be covered in the list of risks

 Austria flagged that risks vary within countries as well, and suggested mention of vulnerable groups within countries

<p class="textstory">Following the presentation of various formulations of, and discussion on, this text, Canada proposed that “some key risks may be particularly challenging for LDCs and communities, given their higher vulnerability and limited ability to cope,” to which the UK proposed adding “vulnerable” communities

<p class="textstory">Mali, supported by Sudan, called for text stating that key risks “are,” rather than “may be,” challenging for LDCs, while Austria, supported by Canada, pointed out that no assessment was carried out specifically on key risks in LDCs, and that such a definitive declaration was thus not in line with the assessment

 France proposed deleting “some,” while South Sudan suggested that “most of these key risks are” challenging for LDCs

 A suggestion from Pakistan, to add “displacement” to the effects of inland flooding, was rejected on the basis that it is captured in the existing language

<p class="textstory">On the key risk of excess mortality and morbidity during periods of extreme heat<em>, </em>“excess” was removed upon request from Tanzania and Canada

 Participants agreed to a request by Ecuador and Ethiopia that the final clause refer to “those working outdoors in urban and rural areas

<p class="textstory">On the key risk of food insecurity linked to warming, drought, flooding, and precipitation variability and extremes, particularly for poorer urban and rural populations, the reference to food insecurity was expanded to include the “breakdown of food systems,” from the underlying report, upon request from Bolivia

<p class="textstory">On the key risk of loss of rural livelihoods and income, a suggestion by India to add reference to farmers in “arid” regions was rejected as inconsistent with the report, and the key risk was approved without change

<p class="textstory">On the key risk of loss of marine ecosystems and biodiversity, a suggestion from Bolivia to add “functions” to ecosystem goods and services was accepted

<p class="textstory">On the key risk of loss of terrestrial and inland water ecosystems, upon request from Tanzania and the US, a reference to the concept of “terrestrial” livelihoods was deleted

 Norway noted that the term “freshwater” used elsewhere should be harmonized with “inland water

 Germany, the UK, Luxembourg, Saint Lucia, Belgium, Finland and others expressed concern that 4ºC had been identified as the critical threshold, given the many serious risks associated with lower temperature increases, and cautioned against giving the impression that impacts below an increase of 4ºC are manageable

 Supporting Belgium, Germany, Finland, Saint Lucia, the Philippines and others also called for adding details associated with lower levels of warming, including risks associated with an increase of 2ºC above preindustrial levels

<p class="textstory">The UK, supported by Belgium, Luxembourg, Australia, Saint Lucia and the US, proposed language from the underlying report referring to major impacts

 On the reference to “preindustrial levels,” Australia suggested referring to the period 1850-1900 instead to ensure consistency with WGI benchmarks

<p class="textstory">Saudi Arabia, China and the UK argued that the paragraph should be limited to consideration of the risks of a very high temperature rise

 Saint Lucia, Germany, Jamaica, Austria, Sweden, Belgium and Tuvalu called for examples of risks associated even with lower temperature rises

 Switzerland suggested referring to RCPs used in the WGI report, rather than temperatures, for consistency across the WGs

 Sweden suggested moving this language to the introduction of the paragraph, stating that precise levels of climate change sufficient to trigger tipping points remain uncertain, but the likelihood of crossing tipping points in the earth system or in interlinked human and natural systems increases with rising GHG concentrations

 Mexico noted that Table SPM

 Bolivia called for putting a comparison of temperatures from 1850-1950 in a footnote

<p class="textstory">Saudi Arabia, opposed by Switzerland, reiterated that the paragraph should be considered as a package, not sentence by sentence, and should remain focused on a 4ºC temperature rise relative to preindustrial levels

 Austria and the US emphasized that temperature references to warming of 1-2°C were intended to reflect a continuous increase in temperature and not a threshold in relation to increased risk

” Spain recalled WGI’s use of the 1986-2005 baseline and its reference to the difference in warming from the preindustrial period and the 1986-2005 baseline

 Luxembourg proposed adding the WGI SPM language, namely that observed warming from 1850-1900 to 1996-2005 is 0

 This deletion was accepted, with Norway reiterating that the chapeau already includes reference to the 1986-2005 baseline

” Switzerland opposed this proposal, expressing that risk is defined as constituting vulnerability and exposure and this sentence would create circular reasoning, stating that the people most at risk are those who have the greatest risk

 The US, supported by Saint Lucia and the Philippines, said disadvantaged people are not restricted to those that are vulnerable and exposed, and opposed the proposed change

 China favored reference to risks being generally greatest in low-latitude, less developed areas

 Mexico said the sentence should also address LDCs

 The US, supported by New Zealand and the EU, and opposed by Argentina, expressed concern that this would dilute the point that risks are unevenly distributed and are generally greater for people in the weakest economic situations

 Mexico said risk and vulnerability do not always depend on exposure to risk and that capacity to respond must also be addressed

” Tanzania proposed, and participants agreed, to replace “greatest” with “greater

 After requests for clarification from Belgium, Switzerland and the UK on the distribution of impacts, Switzerland suggested, and participants agreed to, stating that “risks of unevenly distributed impacts are high

” Saudi Arabia, Australia and the US questioned the differing confidence levels associated with the statement

 The UK, the US and Australia proposed separate sentences for biodiversity and economy

 Belgium and Venezuela supported maintaining aggregate indicators

 The US, with Australia, proposed language from the underlying chapter stating that little is known about economic impacts under a 3ºC increase, but that this does not imply a lack of risk

 Norway, opposed by Saudi Arabia, suggested including this definition of “moderate” in a footnote

 IPCC Chair Pachauri, supported by Luxembourg and the UK, suggested adding a footnote with previously agreed text from the SREX noting that disaster loss estimates are lower bound estimates because many impacts, such as loss of human lives, cultural heritage and ecosystem services, are difficult to value and monetize and thus are poorly reflected in estimates of losses

<p class="textstory">On the RFC on <strong>large-scale singular events</strong>, Canada requested the removal of “drastic” in a sentence on physical systems and ecosystems being at risk of abrupt, drastic and irreversible changes

 Austria suggested using the word “transformational” and Australia proposed “far-reaching

” Norway called for consistency with the WGI report, which refers to “abrupt” and “irreversible

” Peru queried whether “drastic” referred to scale, and a CLA clarified that it referred to the rate and was thus redundant

” On a sentence concerning early warning signs of warm-water coral reefs and Arctic ecosystems experiencing irreversible regime shifts, Switzerland queried the meaning of “Arctic ecosystems

 Japan and Tanzania sought clarification on a disproportionate increase in risks associated with temperature increases between 1-2°C

 Japan, China and Australia pointed to inconsistency between the temperature ranges used by WGI and WGII

 Luxembourg suggested specifying that global mean sea-level rise would be “up to 7 meters

 Australia, the US, the EU, Sweden and others opposed the use of two different timeframes

 China expressed concern over the vagueness of the term “preindustrial” and urged consistency with the terminology used in WGI to avoid confusing policymakers

 Australia said the caption should state that the figure presents untreated risks, and in some areas there is potential for adaptation to mitigate those risks

 To address this concern, Norway suggested merging this figure with Figure 19

 Mali and Ghana said the figure needed to be simplified and better explained

 Saudi Arabia, Bolivia and India queried why the scale used is based on recent temperatures and not on a preindustrial baseline

 Ecuador, opposed by Slovenia and Spain, favored deleting the figure noting it is unrepresentative

 Responding to concerns raised by Saudi Arabia that the temperature scale should be based on preindustrial baselines, Austria said a baseline of recent emissions is not a political baseline and is scientifically grounded

 Costa Rica, supported by Sweden and Switzerland, proposed adding an explanation of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and scenarios in the caption, noting that the terms are not familiar to all policymakers

 Emphasizing the figure’s importance and value, Switzerland urged that it contain all information necessary for use as a stand-alone and self-explanatory figure and suggested including a description of RCPs or scenarios in the figure itself

” WGI Co-Chair Thomas Stocker said that reference to “preindustrial” would necessitate use of the term “approximation,” which Austria and Australia proposed including in a footnote

 China requested text noting that while the earliest data is available for 1850-1900, “preindustrial times” start around 1750

<p class="textstory">IPCC Vice-Chair van Ypersele, supported by Norway, proposed inserting a footnote providing a link between the figure and the notion of “preindustrial” based on WGI’s work

 A revised figure incorporating <span dir="rtl"> </span>the changes was then presented, which included the addition of the label “global temperature change” on the Y axis, as proposed by Slovenia, and a thermometer showing global mean temperature change relative to 1986-2005 levels aligned with the existing thermometer showing global mean temperature change relative to 1850-1900

 Germany, Austria and Sweden objected to the removal of dotted lines that indicated 2°C and 4°C temperature changes above preindustrial levels

 Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia objected to the use of “neutral” rather than “low” level of risk

 Norway asked for insertion of an explanation of the criteria for distinguishing levels of risk

 Australia called for including this explanation in the caption

<p class="textstory">Saint Lucia, supported by Mali, Dominica, Jamaica, Tuvalu, Cuba, France and others, and opposed by Australia, requested the inclusion of a dotted line at 1

 Germany supported including a dotted line at 1

 The UK, supported by Slovenia, proposed removing all dotted lines so as to appear scientifically neutral

 CLAs, supported by Belgium, the US, Austria and others, and opposed by Saint Lucia, proposed adding dotted lines at all 0

<p class="textstory">Saudi Arabia, the Bahamas, Venezuela, Slovenia, Germany and the Russian Federation questioned a reference in the figure to “neutral” level of risk

 Germany pointed out that there have already been impacts from extreme weather events

” Saudi Arabia and Mali expressed concern that the link could be misleading so as to appear that only the “very high risk” category is linked to limited adaptive capacity

 Mexico noted that, if the category “very high risk” is defined as beyond adaptive capacity, referring to it as “limited” in a figure representing it is problematic

<p class="textstory"><strong><em>Coastal systems and low-lying areas:</em></strong> Regarding a paragraph stating that due to sea-level rise throughout this century and beyond, coastal systems and low-lying areas will increasingly experience adverse impacts, Switzerland, the US, Canada and Saudi Arabia suggested insertion of “are projected to” experience adverse impacts, rather than “will

” Australia and the Bahamas opposed, noting “projected” is not definitive enough

<p class="textstory">Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana called for reference to Africa in a sentence stating that by 2100 without adaptation, hundreds of millions of people will be affected by coastal flooding and displaced due to land loss, particularly in Asia

 Australia, Canada and the US expressed concern regarding the accuracy of and inferences arising from the text

6: Climate Change Risks for Fisheries</strong> with changes arising from suggestions made by the US on changing the number of exploited fish (1060 instead of “approximately 1000”) and by Sweden on inserting language stating “approximately equivalent to ppm in the atmosphere” to clarify <em>μ</em>atm (microatmospheres)

<p class="textstory"><strong><em>Food security and food production systems:</em></strong> On a sentence on impacts of projected climate change without adaptation on the major crops, in response to queries from Tanzania and the UK, a CLA explained that: confidence goes down when restricting projections to certain crops and regions; and the use of local temperatures was consistent with the literature

 Germany inquired why 2°C was used as a reference point, and a CLA explained that the number is a conservative reflection of all the crops analyzed

<p class="textstory">A number of participants, including the UK, Slovenia and Austria, found a sentence on climate change reducing yields, as compared to a baseline without climate change, lacking transparency for policymakers

” The UK, Australia and Saint Lucia found a sentence on agricultural adaptation improving yields misleading and it was deleted

 The UK and Australia proposed referring to “global” temperature increase

 India noted that local warming generally exceeds global warming

 Germany suggested that “non-production elements of the food system” be made more explicit

” Norway suggested linking food security to changes in marine fisheries catch potential, which was agreed

7: Summary of Projected Changes in Crop Yields due to Climate Change over the 21st Century</strong>, Brazil asked whether the figure refers to total global production and Slovenia, Ghana and Sweden expressed concern that it does not distinguish between adaptation and no adaptation cases

 Slovenia cautioned that the figure may be misleading as it implies that adaptation does not affect yields

 The UK expressed concern that the figure does not state how the risk to food varies with temperature and, with Austria, stressed that information on the risk of reduction of yields is important

 Austria, India and Sweden suggested adding an explanation in the caption

<p class="textstory"><strong><em>Urban areas:</em></strong>The section on urban areas was approved after additions from Ecuador, Venezuela, Norway and Panama

 The text states that: many global risks of climate change are concentrated in urban areas; steps that build resilience and enable sustainable development can accelerate adaptation; heat stress, extreme precipitation, inland and coastal flooding, landslides (inserted by Ecuador, Venezuela and Norway), air pollution (inserted by Norway), drought and water scarcity and vector-borne diseases (inserted by Panama) pose risks in urban areas; risks are amplified for those lacking essential infrastructure or in poor quality housing and exposed areas; and reducing basic service deficits, improving housing and building resilient infrastructure systems could significantly reduce vulnerability and exposure

<p class="textstory"><strong><em>Rural areas:</em></strong>In this section, Botswana suggested adding the word “availability” to language on impacts on water supply

 Regional Key Risks and Potential for Adaptation:</strong> In the chapeau, Austria requested addition of language noting that “the assessment of risk does not take into account adaptation action that may be taken in the future

<p class="textstory">On a statement referring readers to an extended summary of regional risks and the limited potential benefits, Australia and Canada called for deletion of “limited” potential benefits, to provide balance

 Tanzania expressed concern that language on “risk perception” was not appropriate for determining risk levels

 Canada suggested language stating that risk levels vary “over time” as well, which was accepted

 Afghanistan and Panama proposed inserting reference to “resilience

<p class="textstory">On <strong>Africa</strong>, Tanzania, with Mali, Sudan, Kenya, Botswana, Ghana, the Gambia, Chad, and South Africa, supported by the Russian Federation, Nicaragua and Saudi Arabia, objected to the absence of reference to droughts and their socio-economic impacts in the key risk on compounded stress on water resources from overexploitation and degradation

 Other absences noted were: desertification (Sudan); flooding, sea-level rise and cyclones (Kenya); and tidal waves (Ghana)

” Tanzania, Mali and others suggested including a reference to risks to livelihoods, socio-economic aspects and life

 Botswana proposed referring to impacts on the quality of agricultural production

 Senegal asked for explicit reference to animal husbandry among the impacts, but the CLAs clarified that it is included under food security

 Tanzania, South Africa, the Gambia, Kenya, Mali and others proposed, and participants agreed, to include reference to enhanced observation systems as an adaptation issue and prospect

 Sudan, with South Sudan, Kenya and Swaziland, suggested adding reference to agroforestry and reforestation as an adaptation response

 IPCC Vice-Chair El Gizouli expressed concern regarding the reference to “European directives,” with Canada cautioning against using policy-prescriptive language

 Austria, supported by the EU, suggested using “European legislation” and Switzerland, with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, suggested the more neutral term of “European legislations

” Sweden urged deleting any reference to European legislation

 Australia recommended stating “practices showing to be best practices in the European context

<p class="textstory">On <strong>Asia,</strong> on the key risk on increased flooding leading to widespread damage to infrastructure and settlements, Indonesia called for language on economic risks or livelihoods

 Japan suggested adding risks in coastal zones, such as sea-level rise, storm surges and typhoons

” India preferred “increased riverine flooding and coastal flooding” at the beginning, to which Saudi Arabia added “urban flooding

” Pakistan noted that risks from flooding include risks to food security and water security

 On corresponding adaptation issues and prospects, India asked to change “construction” to “commissioning” of monitoring and early warning systems

<p class="textstory">On an increased risk of mortality, India requested addition of “cold-related mortality” to the reference to heat-related mortality and, with Japan, Singapore and Indonesia, suggested adding “vector- and water-borne disease due to increase in temperature

<p class="textstory">On the key risk of drought-related water and food shortage, Pakistan requested adding “energy” shortage due to likely shortage of water

 Saudi Arabia, supported by Tajikistan, called for inclusion of dust storms, water stress, dwindling water resources combined with increasing population, and desertification

 India, supported by Jordan, highlighted groundwater shortages

<p class="textstory">India, supported by Indonesia, said climate-resilient agriculture should be included as an adaptation issue

<p class="textstory">In the section on <strong>Australasia</strong>, on the key risk of significant change in community composition and structure of coral reefs and montane ecosystems, Australia requested deletion of reference to montane ecosystems in order to not dilute the focus

<p class="textstory">On <strong>Central and South America</strong>, Nicaragua suggested, and participants agreed, that landslides should be included as a threat and rural areas should be included as vulnerable areas with respect to water availability risks

 Participants also agreed with Ecuador to include “rural” flood management as an adaptation prospect

 Nicaragua added that reference to integrated water resource management should be included as an adaptation prospect

 Regarding adaptation issues arising from the risk of decreased food production and food quality, Bolivia and Nicaragua suggested, and participants agreed to, referring to the use of traditional knowledge and practice and replacing “carbon” with “climate change” as a reason for needing to develop new crop varieties

 Panama said the spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever should be mentioned as a risk

<p class="textstory">On <strong>polar regions</strong>, Canada suggested, and participants agreed, that the adaptation prospect of “negotiation of land claim rights” should be clarified to read “adaptive co-management through the settlement of land claims

 India suggested reference to public financing

 Saudi Arabia, opposed by Australia, called for removing reference to local and subnational governments

<p class="textstory">China, supported by Saudi Arabia, India and Ghana, opposed by the US and Germany, called for a reference to international cooperation

<p class="textstory">On a sentence stating that “a first step towards adaptation to future climate change is reducing vulnerability and exposure to present climate, including through actions with co-benefits for other objectives (often called low-regrets measures),” Tanzania and Slovenia asked for clarification on the meaning of the sentence “exposure to present climate

” Jamaica and Saudi Arabia proposed, and participants agreed to, alternative language to “vulnerability and exposure” and to “low-regrets measures

<p class="textstory">Regarding a paragraph on adaptation planning and implementation being contingent on values, objectives and risk perception, Bolivia suggested introducing the concept of “world views

” Austria emphasized that social and cultural backgrounds inform world views

 Mexico proposed recognizing “cultural differences,” Peru suggested “cultural practices,” and Nicaragua proposed “social and cultural backgrounds

 Argentina said circumstances and conditions vary greatly within countries as well

 Regarding a sentence on indigenous, local and traditional knowledge being an adaptation resource, Bolivia called for explicit recognition of indigenous peoples’ world views of Mother Earth

 On constraints to implementation, Mexico, Panama and Costa Rica sought a reference to the need for research, with Switzerland requesting references to the need for improved observation and monitoring

<p class="textstory">Regarding the costs of adaptation, Canada, with Austria and Germany, expressed concern over quality of the scientific data behind the text

 Canada proposed language stating: “Estimates, which are highly preliminary due to important omissions and/or shortcomings in data and methods suggest global adaptation costs range very broadly from … (<em>medium confidence</em>)

” India, China and Panama emphasized that previously deleted text must be returned, stating that: “The most recent global adaptation cost estimates for developing countries suggest a range from 70 to 100 US$ billion per year from 2010 to 2050 (<em>low confidence</em>)

” Luxembourg said the applicable climate change scenario should be stated

 Norway said numbers in a SPM must be based on sound science, and the US said using a set of numbers with low confidence is out of place in a SPM

 Brazil, Mali, Peru and South Africa called for more information and discussion regarding the basis for the text

<p class="textstory">Some suggestions for additional changes were put forward, including by Costa Rica on a reference to biological corridors and by Bolivia on inserting “in accordance to national policies and circumstances” to compensate for sensitive issues, such as water pricing

” Responding to a query from Switzerland, a CLA clarified that “due to human impacts” included anthropogenic climate change

 Canada reiterated that limits do not only occur in the natural world

<p class="textstory">Regarding a paragraph on transformations in political, economic, social and technological systems facilitating adaptation and mitigation, and promoting sustainable development, Bolivia asked to redraft it to align the language with the definition of transformation

 Noting that this concern remained unaddressed despite China having communicated it to the WG, he called for inserting language indicating that maps contained in the report are for geographical reference only and urged that these problems be addressed in the final version of the WGII report

 Japan also requested adding a statement, saying that the Sea of Japan is the only internationally established name for the area

 IPCC Secretary Christ noted that UNEP and WMO have advised on the use of this term, suggesting the term Sea of Japan

<p class="textstory"><strong>IPCC-38</strong>: The meeting, held from 25-29 March 2014 in Yokohama, Japan, focused on finalizing the WGII contribution to AR5 titled “Climate Change 2013: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability

<p class="textstory">Jochen Flasbarth, State Secretary, Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety, Germany, welcomed participants

 He noted that while Germany is currently undergoing a transformation in its energy supply system as it phases-out nuclear power and increases its share of renewables, it remains committed to ambitious mitigation targets, including a national target of at least 40% reductions in GHG emissions compared to 1990 levels by 2020

<p class="textstory">Georg Schütte, State Secretary, Federal Ministry for Education and Research, Germany, highlighted, <em>inter alia</em>, the need to: optimize modeling technologies to increase their predicting power, and strengthen mitigation technologies; build a broader knowledge base; strengthen international climate discourse; and “take a closer look” at the interaction between the science-policy interface and political realm

<p class="textstory">On Monday morning, WGIII Co-Chair Ramón Pichs-Madruga (Cuba) opened WGIII-12

 WGIII Co-Chair Youba Sokona (Mali) said more than 38,000 comments had been received from experts and governments

 On a sentence describing the function of the report, Switzerland suggested, and participants agreed to, changing the words “focuses on literature” to “assesses literature

” Saudi Arabia, supported by India, called for reference to the IPCC’s special report on carbon capture and storage in a sentence describing the literature on which the report is based

 Switzerland suggested, and participants agreed to, adding a reference to previous reports

<p class="textstory">Venezuela, supported by China, Bolivia, Peru and Tanzania, lamented the removal from the text of a reference to UNFCCC Article 2 (Objective of the Convention)

 India called for reintroduction of deleted text on the definition of mitigation and climate policy

<p class="textstory">Saudi Arabia, supported by China, called for retaining language from the December SPM draft version, emphasizing that the report does not recommend particular goals for mitigation, but assesses available options

 Switzerland, supported by Tanzania and Norway, said the reference to the report not recommending particular goals for mitigation is superfluous as IPCC reports are not intended to be prescriptive

<p class="textstory">In the final introductory paragraph on the degree of certainty of findings, Switzerland suggested, and participants agreed, to state that the language on of the degree of certainty is consistent across the WG reports

 Regarding a footnote, Norway suggested, and participants agreed to, text referring to the guidance note for Lead Authors on consistent treatment of uncertainties

<p class="textstory">Venezuela, supported by Bolivia, suggested reinserting an introductory paragraph referencing UNFCCC Article 2 to set the context for the section, noting its inclusion of many complex issues

 The US, Tanzania, Canada, South Sudan and France suggested various formulations without using the term “global commons

<p class="textstory">Supporting the insertion of a glossary entry proposed by Switzerland, a CLA pointed out that the global commons concept is defined in the social sciences and that the following sentences in the paragraph provide further explanation of the concept and its relevance

<p class="textstory">Many participants, including Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Bolivia and Malaysia, noted difficulties in moving forward with text in SPM

 Saudi Arabia, supported by Brazil, Malaysia, Bolivia and South Sudan, stressed the importance of addressing responsibilities when referring to global commons, and called for using the December version of the paragraph, which refers to climate change as a global commons problem that implies the need for international cooperation

<p class="textstory">Bolivia, supported by the UK, the US and the Netherlands, proposed addressing the issue and the entire SPM

 The contact group, which was chaired by Austria and Mexico, met from Monday to Thursday

3 stating: “<strong>Total anthropogenic GHG emissions rose more rapidly from 2000 to 2010 than in each of the previous three decades</strong>,” China and Canada questioned the accuracy of the statement

 Saudi Arabia and India called for citing a broader timeline, stating this would be more representative of trends

 Canada, supported by Saudi Arabia, proposed stating that “total anthropogenic GHG emissions rose in each of the previous four decades

” Norway, supported by Germany, Luxembourg and Ireland, favored keeping the statement as is

 A CLA said the finding is not due to low emissions in 2000, as suggested by Canada

<p class="textstory">On a footnote stating that GHG emissions in the SPM are weighted by global warming potential (GWP) with a 100-year time horizon from the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report, Brazil proposed a sentence from the WGI report, stating: “The choice of type of emission metric and time horizon involves explicit or implicit value judgments

” Brazil, supported by Peru, China, Bolivia and Saint Lucia and opposed by the US, the European Union (EU), Norway and Australia, recommended that a further sentence from the WGI report be added, stating: “No single metric can accurately compare all consequences of different emissions, and all have limitations and uncertainties

” The US, Norway, Luxembourg, the EU, France and others said Brazil’s latter proposal was out of context, with the US noting that it gave a misleading impression that the different metrics have equal levels of uncertainty

 Switzerland proposed that the footnote simply refer readers to the WGI SPM and IPCC websites for more information

 Canada, supported by South Sudan, suggested compromise text stating: “All metrics have limitations and uncertainties

 New Zealand, Norway, Luxembourg, Sweden, the UK, the EU and others supported the CLA’s proposal, but agreed to include a reference to the WGI SPM as well

 Luxembourg suggested also adding a sentence explaining that “this is the common metric used up to now under the UNFCCC

” Saudi Arabia, supported by Austria, Trinidad and Tobago, Republic of Korea and others, proposed stating that “all metrics have limitations and uncertainties in assessing the consequences of different emissions

5, as suggested by Peru

<p class="textstory">Regarding a sentence in the paragraph on GHG emissions growth, stating: “<strong>80% of the recent GHG emissions growth from 2000 to 2010 has been from the combustion of fossil fuels</strong>,” Saudi Arabia, supported by Venezuela, Egypt, Sierra Leone, Qatar, Iraq and others, suggested referring to 1970-2010 to be consistent with the previous paragraph and supported consideration of other sectors and gases

 China proposed covering all GHG-related gases in the sentence

<p class="textstory">The EU reminded, and a CLA confirmed, that AR5 focuses on the last decade, and, with Germany and Slovenia, that it is a highly relevant measure point for policymakers

 Germany, with Slovenia, highlighted the period from 2000 to 2010 as the most relevant to policymakers

 Germany, supported by the UK, Sweden, Jamaica and Mexico, supported keeping the text as is

” The need to accept and maintain scientific findings was supported by Austria, the Russian Federation, the UK, Ireland, France, Belgium and others

 Austria appealed to participants to accept scientific findings that are “politically relevant and not politically prescriptive” and cautioned against undermining the IPCC’s credibility

 Belgium, with Ireland, reminded participants that “we are here to make a summary for, not by, policymakers

” China questioned the high confidence attached to this statement, given large uncertainties associated with CO2 emissions from Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU) noted in the same paragraph

 Opposed by China, he suggested alternative text linking the high confidence statement to the general statement, and decoupling it from the actual numbers “about 1100 GtCO2 out of 2000 GtCO2

<p class="textstory">After further consultations between China and the CLAs, participants agreed to remove the detailed numbers, noting that these can be calculated on the basis of the sentences that follow, and to state: “about half of cumulative CO2 emissions between 1750 and 2010 have occurred in the last 40 years (<em>high confidence</em>)

<p class="textstory">The US, supported by Switzerland, then proposed adding a sentence to this paragraph stating that non-CO2 emissions account for about 25% of cumulative anthropogenic GHG emissions since 1970, saying that omitting this would be misleading to policymakers

 Noting that this paragraph addresses CO2 emissions, Brazil said the US proposal would be better placed in another paragraph where non-CO2 emissions are discussed, and that including non-CO2 emissions could be equally misleading, remarking that assigning a percentage would depend on the metric and timeframe chosen

<p class="textstory">On the first sentence of a paragraph noting that “<strong>about</strong> <strong>75% of the 10 GtCO2eq growth in annual anthropogenic GHG emissions between 2000 and 2010 comes from the energy supply and industry sectors</strong>,” Saudi Arabia, supported by Qatar and Egypt, opposed focusing on the energy supply and industry sectors, and called for reverting to the December draft version of the SPM where AFOLU and other sectors were also mentioned, in order to be comprehensive and balanced

 This was opposed by the UK, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, which called for retaining the statement as presented, saying that it constituted one of the clearer and more policy-relevant statements of the SPM

” Brazil opposed this addition, noting that AFOLU is not comparable to energy and industry, given much higher uncertainty levels and its dynamic carbon cycle

 Reporting back to plenary, Norway presented the group’s proposal, stating: “Annual anthropogenic GHG emissions have increased by 10 GtCO2eq between 2000 and 2010, with this increase directly coming from energy supply (47%), industry (30%), transport (11%) and buildings (3%) sectors

” India requested a clarification on the fact that the percentages did not add up to 100 percent

 Egypt, supported by Tanzania, enquired about the composition of the buildings sector

 Switzerland suggested adding the respective levels of confidence to each sentence

 The Netherlands suggested, and participants agreed to, adding a glossary entry on “direct” and “indirect” emissions

 On a sentence setting out emissions sources, Brazil suggested, and participants agreed to, text stating that the AFOLU figures represent net emissions

 China requested clarification on the assessment of uncertainty surrounding figures addressing the sectoral level

 Austria, the UK, the US, the EU, Saint Lucia, Madagascar, the Netherlands, Mexico, New Zealand and others expressed concern over this decision and the IPCC’s inability to communicate all relevant information included by the WGIII authors in the SPM

<p class="textstory">In plenary, the proposal was opposed by China, India, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and others, which said no references relating to the deleted text should remain in the SPM

 The US, Slovenia, Norway, France, Canada and others, opposed by Saudi Arabia, supported keeping the references

 Supporting Saint Lucia, Germany urged a reference to decarbonization, stressing that economic growth can occur with low emissions

 Ireland called for emphasis on energy intensity issues

 Switzerland, supported by Slovenia, urged that the text refer to global trends

 Saudi Arabia and Canada, supported by Venezuela, requested that the sentence not refer to fossil fuel “combustion” because this was not included in a previous draft and due to countries’ different circumstances

 Saint Lucia and Norway favored retaining the median values noting that they were policy relevant, and participants agreed to reinsert them

 In response to a query from Norway, a CLA proposed, and participants agreed, to clarify that emissions growth was without additional efforts to reduce GHG emissions “beyond those in place today

” In response to a query from China, a CLA explained that the reason for moving to a wider temperature range in the mean values was to maintain consistency with WGI and to indicate temperature uncertainties in future scenarios without additional mitigation

 Canada requested including quantitative parameters of additional mitigation

 China suggested, and participants agreed, to delete text stating that “higher temperatures cannot be excluded due to climate response uncertainties

<p class="textstory">On drivers of emissions growth, Slovenia and the EU supported referring to “economic growth,” whereas Saudi Arabia, China, Sierra Leone, Senegal and Qatar favored “economic activities

” China emphasized that climate change impacts were due not only to growth in emissions but also to existing GHG stocks

<p class="textstory">On a footnote explaining the integrated models that were used to generate the long-term scenarios assessed in the WGIII report, Japan requested replacing “cost-effective” with “idealized

 Bolivia recalled a long discussion in WGII on the term and concept of “transformation,” and suggested including that same definition here

” In response to questions by Saint Lucia, Canada, the US and Saudi Arabia on the inclusion of scenarios below 430 ppm, the CLAs explained that only two studies had scenarios below 430 ppm and that these included two different models, which made them incompatible and did not allow for their inclusion in the database used in the report

 Australia suggested, and participants agreed, to add text clarifying that scenarios outside the mentioned range were also assessed, including some scenarios below 430 ppm, and referring to a paragraph where that problem is adequately explained

<p class="textstory">On a sentence stating that “the mitigation scenarios are based on a range of technological, socioeconomic and institutional trajectories,” Bolivia queried the extent to which only market-based approaches were considered in the scenarios, and called for explicit reference to this matter

 Canada, supported by the CLAs, suggested referring to the relevant chapter in the underlying report for a discussion of uncertainties and scenarios

 This was opposed by Luxembourg and Switzerland, which noted that uncertainty was already mentioned elsewhere in the paragraph

<p class="textstory">The discussion was forwarded to small group consultations between Bolivia, Saudi Arabia and the CLAs, which agreed that “the mitigation scenarios involve a wide range of technological, socioeconomic and institutional trajectories, but uncertainties and model limitations exist and developments outside this range are possible

 Switzerland suggested including a reference to CDR technologies

 Canada requested that the language be clarified to reflect overshooting “to” 530 ppm, not overshooting “by” 530 ppm

 Slovenia cautioned that 530 ppm should not be made to be seen as a threshold

 Norway said the issue of 3°C scenarios is addressed elsewhere and, thus, references in this paragraph were redundant

 Norway and Belgium called for, and participants agreed to, the insertion of the word “about” before “650 ppm” to indicate that 650 ppm is not an exact threshold

 Germany suggested adding a sentence referring to scenarios of 580 and 650 ppm and, after consultations, the CLAs proposed new text stating: “Scenarios that reach 550 to 650 ppm CO2eq concentrations by 2100 are <em>more unlikely than likely </em>to keep temperature change below 2°C

” Slovenia pointed out that it should include “relative to preindustrial levels

” Belgium stated that the scenarios should range from 530 to 650 ppm

<p class="textstory"> Canada, supported by Sweden and Denmark, suggested clarifying a sentence stating that “mitigation scenarios in which temperatures peak and are then likelyto bring temperature change to less than 1

” Tanzania and India requested clarification on what “fundamental” changes meant, while Saudi Arabia and Bolivia objected to the term, noting it was too subjective

<p class="textstory">Discussions on this paragraph and the subsequent one on temporary overshoot and reliance on CDR in the scenarios continued in an informal group, co-facilitated by the Netherlands and Brazil

” Responding to a question from China regarding the relation of the Cancún Pledges to the scenarios examined in Figure SPM

 Norway suggested adding a reference to Figure SPM

 Saudi Arabia, supported by India, proposed returning to the December SPM draft text

 On a sentence noting that, while the Cancún Pledges refer to 2020, mitigation actions through 2030 have a substantially larger constraining effect on the pathways and options for meeting long-term temperature goals, Canada said the text does not accurately reflect that the earlier mitigation actions are taken, the less actions are constrained going forward, and suggested language to better reflect this

 Australia questioned the need for the sentence

 Belgium asked why 2030 was highlighted in comparison to 2020

 Canada said this formulation fails to take into account mitigation actions already taking place, and suggested language to reflect this

<p class="textstory">Regarding the first sentence of a paragraph stating that “<strong>delaying mitigation through 2030 will substantially increase the difficulty of the transition to low longer-term emissions levels, and narrow the range of options consistent with maintaining temperature change below 2°C relative to preindustrial levels</strong>,” Canada and Australia proposed referring to “increased mitigation” to reflect that mitigation is already taking place, while the CLAs preferred “mitigation efforts beyond those in place today

” Belgium expressed its preference for “would” instead of “will

” Saudi Arabia, supported by Brazil, said the sentence should refer to projections, and the CLAs proposed text to reflect this

” The US, supported by the UK, Chile, Switzerland, Ireland and Norway, expressed concern over the numbers conveyed in a subsequent sentence stating that “mitigation scenarios that reach atmospheric concentrations of about 450ppm CO2eq by 2100 entail global consumption losses, measured as a change from baseline consumption, of 1% to 4% in 2030, 2% to 6% in 2050, and 3% to 11% in 2100 relative to what would happen without mitigation

 Chile stressed the importance of changing consumption models as “part of the solution

” Switzerland noted that assumptions may “radically” change over the course of the century and asked for reference to the certainty level associated with each timeframe

 Norway requested adding text specifying that the numbers do not consider co-benefits of mitigation and other benefits of reduced climate change

 Switzerland observed that these scenarios require the use of CDR and that this should be mentioned

” Switzerland queried the emphasis on energy security and air quality, Venezuela proposed substituting “energy security” with “energy supply,” and Saudi Arabia called for including adverse side-effects and suggested removing the reference to all other co-benefits apart from energy security and air quality

<p class="textstory">On a sentence stating that the potential for co-benefits for energy end-use measures may outweigh the potential for adverse side-effects, and that evidence suggests this may not be the case for all energy supply and AFOLU measures, Japan questioned reference to AFOLU in this context, while Saudi Arabia opposed emphasizing adverse side effects of both AFOLU and energy supply measures

 Following proposals from the CLAs and Canada, participants agreed to qualifying language reflecting that “the potential for” co-benefits outweighs “the potential for” adverse side effects

<p class="textstory">On a paragraph on the <strong>distribution of costs among different </strong>countries, Switzerland expressed concern that the paragraph could be misinterpreted unless its language was clarified, and the US said scientific elements in the paragraph must be disentangled from policy-prescriptive normative elements

 Norway, Canada and the EU, opposed by Brazil, Saudi Arabia and South Sudan, called for the establishment of an informal contact group to improve the paragraph

<p class="textstory">On a sentence stating: “<strong>Mitigation policy may devalue fossil fuel assets, but differences between regions and fuels exist</strong>,” Switzerland requested that the role of markets in providing value to commodities be acknowledged, and, with the Netherlands, suggested that the value of fossil fuel assets be put into context

 The Netherlands called for a focus on “re-evaluation” of fossil fuel assets, not “devaluation

” The Netherlands said the idea that fossil fuel producers have the infrastructure to become future producers of sustainable energy had not been reflected

<p class="textstory">Regarding a sentence in the same paragraph on the largely negative effects of mitigation policies on coal exporters and their medium-term benefits for natural gas exporters, Norway sought clarification of “medium-term

” Australia queried the meaning of “largely negative

” Argentina asked what time period the statement referred to

 Norway stated its concern over coherence with WGI and called for a reference to the issues related to the potential of terrestrial carbon removals

 Australia said this reference would fit better in section SPM

<p class="textstory">Regarding a sentence stating that, in baseline scenarios, net CO2 emissions from the AFOLU sector will decline over time, with some models projecting a net sink towards the end of the century, Saudi Arabia, with Ireland, suggested that non-CO2 gases in AFOLU are expected to increase

 Responding to a query from Brazil on whether this statement referred to forests only, the CLAs clarified that some of the models include carbon sequestration in agricultural soils

 Brazil opposed the proposal to reference non-CO2 emissions from the AFOLU sector, preferring to emphasize only agriculture

<p class="textstory">Responding to a concern expressed by Luxembourg, CLAs clarified that WGIII is only addressing anthropogenic emissions in AFOLU, while WGI also includes carbon cycle feedback

” Switzerland proposed adding “materials” to products and infrastructure

 Bolivia expressed concern that the message suggests that the only solution is not to build infrastructure in developing countries

 Participants approved the sentence with the addition of “materials,” as suggested by Switzerland

<p class="textstory">Regarding a paragraph on <strong>interdependencies in mitigation scenarios,</strong> India expressed reservations over use of the term “decarbonization

 Noting the strong demand growth in energy use in developing countries, China, supported by India, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, expressed doubt over the term “demand reductions

 India suggested inserting “demand rationalization after meeting the energy demand

 Switzerland proposed omitting the word “reduction” and Canada suggested referring to energy efficiency improvements instead of demand reductions

 Norway suggested adding “energy conservation

” Stressing the need to expand “energy grids” in many countries, Brazil suggested clarifying that the sentence is only valid under certain circumstances

 Armenia proposed language reflecting “demand reduction that does not prevent sustainable development from happening

” Armenia and Chile, opposed by India, suggested the insertion of “sustainable” before “development” as an additional qualifier

 India added that the words “may be” should qualify these as a key mitigation strategy

 Switzerland suggested, and participants agreed, to use the CLA’s proposal with the addition of language stating that the changes to reducing energy demand compared to baseline scenarios

<p class="textstory">On a sentence stating that “near-term reductions in energy demand are an important element of cost-effective mitigation strategies,” India suggested deleting a reference to decarbonizing the energy supply sector

<p class="textstory">Regarding the first sentence of a paragraph stating that “<strong>behaviour, lifestyle and culture have a considerable influence on energy use and associated emissions</strong>, with high mitigation potential in some sectors, in particular when complementing technological and structural change,” Bolivia said reference to “structural change” would cause concern among policymakers in Bolivia, given the term’s use in other contexts

 On a sentence stating that “a number of options such as monetary incentives and information measures to improve public awareness may facilitate behavioral changes,” Bolivia, supported by Switzerland and Canada, called for reference to “non-monetary” incentives

 Switzerland said capacity building should be referenced

 Tanzania suggested, and participants agreed, that the reference to public awareness should be deleted as incentives do not create such awareness

 Energy Supply Sector</strong>: On the section’s opening sentence stating that “<strong>direct CO2 emissions from the energy supply sector are projected to almost double or even triple by 2050</strong>,” Saudi Arabia, opposed by Switzerland, requested that a caveat in the December version of the SPM should be reinserted, stating “unless energy intensity improvements can be improved beyond historical development

 Norway suggested that emission reduction potential in other sectors should also be referenced

 Switzerland expressed concern regarding the new proposed text, stating that energy intensity is only one driver of emissions and that other drivers, such as population and income growth, are also factors

 Peru urged clarifying that the focus is on energy intensity improvements

” Belgium urged specifying the lower end for the emissions levels

<p class="textstory">Tanzania and Senegal expressed concern over the term “scarcity” in a sentence stating that “the scarcity of fossil fuels alone will not be sufficient to limit CO2eq concentration to levels, such as 450 ppm, 550 ppm, or 650 ppm, by 2100

” Australia, supported by the Netherlands and the UK, and opposed by Saint Lucia, proposed only referring to 650 ppm

<p class="textstory">In the first sentence of the following paragraph stating that “<strong>decarbonizing electricity generation is a key component of cost-effective mitigation strategies in achieving low-stabilization levels</strong>,” India, supported by Saudi Arabia, proposed replacing “decarbonizing” with “reducing carbon intensity

” New Zealand, the UK, Canada, Ireland and others opposed this proposal, stressing that “decarbonization” is a widely agreed term that also appears in the WGIII glossary

<p class="textstory">On the first sentence of a paragraph on <strong>scaling up of renewable energy (RE)</strong>, stating that “many RE technologies have advanced substantially in terms of performance and cost” and “many have achieved a level of technical and economic maturity, the US, supported by Tanzania, Germany and Peru, suggested changing “cost” to “cost-effectiveness” in order to avoid misinterpretations

 Denmark, supported by Norway and Germany, called for mentioning co-benefits of RE, and for reinserting a sentence from the underlying report stating that “the aggregated global technical potential for RE as a whole is significantly higher than global energy demands

, carbon pricing and/or direct technology support), if their market shares are to be significantly increased,” Japan, Germany and the EU, supported by the CLAs, favored keeping the proposed formulation or returning to the formulation of the December version of the SPM draft, which distinguished between direct and indirect policy support and mentioned more examples, including feed-in tariffs

 Bolivia, Venezuela, Argentina and others preferred not to include any examples

 Bolivia, opposed by Switzerland, suggested deleting references to carbon pricing

 Answering a question from Brazil, the CLAs confirmed that carbon pricing includes not only carbon markets but also carbon taxes, among other things

 Brazil disagreed, noting that the contexts were different

 Spain called for adding reference to a secure level playing field,” which was opposed to by CLAs who said this would be policy prescriptive

 Switzerland suggested referring to “institutional, technological and economic barriers

<p class="textstory">On a sentence in the next paragraph, stating “<strong>nuclear energy is a mature low GHG emission technology</strong> and although its share of global electricity generation has been declining (since 1993), it could make an increasing contribution to low-carbon energy supply,” Austria, supported by Germany and the CLAs, and opposed by Canada and the US, proposed deletion of “it could make an increasing contribution to low-carbon energy supply

 Noting that “barriers” are exogenous to the development of a particular technology, Belgium proposed replacing “barriers” with “risks

” The CLAs proposed “barriers and risks,” which was supported by Austria, Luxembourg and Saudi Arabia

 Germany then proposed language to reflect an increasing, but still low, contribution

” The US, opposed by Belgium and Austria, preferred “concerns about operational safety

<p class="textstory">On a sentence stating that “new fuel cycles and reactor technologies addressing some of these issues are being investigated and progress has been made concerning safety and waste disposal,” participants agreed to a suggestion by Austria to refer to progress in research and development

<p class="textstory">On a sentence stating that “<strong>GHG emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing coal-fired power plants</strong> with modern, highly efficient natural gas combined cycle power plants or combined heat and power plants, provided that natural gas is available and the fugitive emissions associated with extraction and supply are low or mitigated,” Japan proposed, and participants agreed to, adding “current world average” before coal-fired power plants as stated in the underlying report

<p class="textstory">Saudi Arabia, supported by Qatar, called for deleting a sentence stating that “risks associated with CCS include concerns about the operational safety and long-term integrity of geological CO2 storage as well as CO2 transport,” saying that the risk of gas transport was higher than that of CO2 transport, and citing limited evidence to support the statement

 Norway and Germany noted that concern about operational safety is not a risk

” The US, supported by Norway and the CLAs, suggested using language from the underlying report referring to a growing body of literature on: how to ensure the integrity of CO2 wells; the potential consequences of pressure build-up within a geologic formation caused by CO2 storage; and the potential human health and environmental impacts from CO2 that migrates out of the primary injection zone

<p class="textstory">On a paragraph starting with a sentence stating that “<strong>many low stabilization scenarios heavily rely on combining bioenergy and CCS (BECCS) </strong>in an effort to achieve a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere,” Japan, supported by Tanzania, suggested an alternative formulation that included reference to technological challenges and risks

 Brazil, opposed by Germany and Norway, objected to the reference to challenges and risks, and offered an alternative formulation from the underlying report stating that “combining bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) offers the prospect of energy supply with negative emissions, which plays an important role in many low stabilization scenarios

” Participants agreed to this suggestion with an added reference to challenges and risks, as proposed by Japan

 Some discussion ensued between Brazil, Norway, Luxembourg and the CLAs about net negative emissions, with participants agreeing to language on “large-scale net negative emissions

” Norway drew attention to challenges other than technological ones, including to biodiversity, and called for a more general reference to challenges and risks

<p class="textstory">On a paragraph on<strong> potential and constraints of strategies to reduce carbon intensity in transport</strong>, relating to a sentence stating: “Mitigation potential of biofuels will depend on technology advances and on the level of emissions associated with the availability of sustainable feedstock supplies,” Norway, supported by Germany, suggested adding “in the production of” biofuels after “technology advances

” Brazil suggested removing the sentence given similar language elsewhere in the SPM

” After consultations between the CLAs, Brazil and Norway, participants agreed to the following sentence: “Commercially available liquid and gaseous biofuels already provide co-benefits together with mitigation options that can be increased by technology advances

<p class="textstory">On a sentence on reducing black carbon and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, the US, supported by Switzerland, suggested replacing black carbon and NOx with particulate matter and ozone and aerosol precursors

 Switzerland also proposed adding tropospheric ozone

 Mexico called for keeping black carbon

 Norway, supported by Luxembourg and the US and opposed by Saudi Arabia, stressed the importance of keeping NOx, stating that it was better understood by policymakers

 On the<strong> influence of regional differences in the choice of transport mitigation options</strong>, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia suggested, and participants agreed to, revisions reflecting how recommendations on transport measures apply to countries in different situations

<p class="textstory"><strong><em>Buildings:</em></strong> On a sentence on <strong>final energy use and GHG emissions in buildings</strong>, Norway suggested adding text on mitigation potentials

 Only a sentence on the reduction of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) emissions by process optimization and refrigerant recovery, recycling and substitution as key mitigation opportunities prompted discussion, with China noting that the section was not comprehensive enough and calling for including mention of barriers to these mitigation opportunities

 Switzerland suggested adding reference to barriers at the end of the sentence, followed by a reference from the underlying report, as suggested by China

 On a sentence stating that the “<strong>AFOLU sector accounts for about a quarter of net anthropogenic GHG emissions originating mainly from deforestation, agricultural emissions from soil and nutrient management and livestock</strong>,” Switzerland, opposed by Brazil, called for disaggregated figures on deforestation and agriculture, given the REDD+ process under the UNFCCC

<p class="textstory">Regarding a paragraph beginning with a sentence stating that “<strong>the most cost-effective forestry options are afforestation, forest management and reducing deforestation</strong>” and that, “in agriculture, low carbon prices favor cropland and grazing land management, and high carbon prices favor restoration of organic soils,” Bolivia opposed linking forest management to carbon pricing

 Germany suggested using the term “sustainable” forest management

 Ireland supported reference to the sustainable enhancement of food production as a key mitigation option, but the CLAs cautioned against singling out one particular mitigation option

 China asked, and the authors and participants agreed, to include language on barriers to implementation of mitigation options

<p class="textstory">Requesting deletion of the entire paragraph, Bolivia said the SPM was sending contradictory messages regarding, on the one hand, decarbonizing energy and, on the other, carbonizing sectors linked to natural resources

 On a sentence stating that, “if implemented sustainably, REDD+ can be a cost-effective mitigation policy option with potential economic, social and other environmental and adaptation co-benefits,” Brazil said REDD+ has safeguards to ensure that it is implemented sustainably and, with Peru, that stating this in the text is unnecessary

 Noting various REDD processes, Bolivia called for the removal of the REDD+ acronym and for replacing it with its full meaning to avoid confusion

 Brazil suggested text stating that “REDD+ is a cost-effective policy option for mitigating climate change” and referring to the glossary definition of REDD+ in a footnote

 Canada proposed, and participants agreed to, revised text stating that, when implemented sustainably, activities to reduce forest emissions are cost-effective policy options for mitigating climate change

<p class="textstory">On a sentence stating that <strong>bioenergy can play a critical role for mitigation, but issues such as the sustainability of practices and the efficiency of bioenergy systems should be considered</strong>, the Comoros called for adding reference to available arable land

 Brazil opposed, noting that large-scale sustainable options have already been used effectively and sustainably for years and that it was a matter of agricultural productivity, not land availability

 Switzerland, opposed by Brazil and Canada, called for including human health as an additional concern related to bioenergy

 Bolivia called for adding water as a concern

 Brazil objected to the negative connotation given to bioenergy

 Participants also agreed to a suggestion by Brazil to refer to “already available” options in a sentence referring to bioenergy options with low lifecycle emissions, such as sugarcane, which can reduce GHG emissions

<p class="textstory">On a sentence stating that “overall bioenergy outcomes are site-specific and depend on efficient integrated biomass, bioenergy systems, sustainable land-use management and governance,” Brazil objected to presenting efficient integrated biomass, bioenergy systems, sustainable land-use management and governance as conditions for bioenergy

 On a paragraph stating that “<strong>the next two decades present a window of opportunity for mitigation in urban areas</strong>,” China, supported by Saudi Arabia and opposed by the US, the UK and the Netherlands, emphasized that the text does not address infrastructure and suggested reinserting deleted text from the December draft SPM stating: “Currently, average per capita emissions embodied in infrastructure are more than five times higher in industrialized than in developing countries

<p class="textstory">On a paragraph on <strong>substantial reductions in emissions requiring</strong> <strong>large changes in investment patterns</strong>, China asked whether financial needs could be included alongside investment

 Sweden and Norway proposed including information on upside investments

<p class="textstory">On a paragraph stating that <strong>estimates of the financial flows associated with climate mitigation are available</strong>, but widely agreed definitions of what constitutes climate finance are lacking, Peru, supported by the Russian Federation, China, Venezuela and others, called for more emphasis in the text on the lack of widely agreed definitions on climate finance

 Switzerland opposed, noting ongoing processes towards a climate finance definition

 Responding to observations by China and the Russian Federation on the sentence being contradictory, a CLA explained that although widely agreed definitions of climate finance are lacking in the UNFCCC negotiations, this is not the case for the scientific community

, ‘total climate finance,’ USD 343 to 385 billion per year are estimated to flow into mitigation and adaptation projects globally,” which also included a footnote defining “total climate finance” as including all financial flows whose expected effect is to reduce net GHG emissions and/or to enhance resilience to climate change, Venezuela, supported by China, the Maldives, the Philippines and others, called for deleting the sentence, noting lack of clarity regarding how these figures were calculated, given the absence of a widely agreed definition of climate finance

 The Maldives and Saudi Arabia stressed that applying the definition of “total climate finance” to estimate financial flows was prescriptive, and called for using more general ranges instead of specific figures

 On a proposal by Canada to refer to “published assessments” of total climate finance and a suggestion by Peru to include a definition of “total climate finance,” the CLAs proposed, and delegates agreed to, text stating: “Published assessments of all current annual financial flows whose expected effect is to reduce net GHGs and/or to enhance resilience to climate change and climate variability show USD 343 to 385 billion per year globally

<p class="textstory">On a sentence stating that “total public climate finance currently flowing to developing countries is estimated to be between USD 35 to 49 billion per year,” the Maldives, supported by Malaysia and China, expressed concern over accuracy of the figures, and suggested including reference to the needs of developing countries

 Venezuela, opposed by Canada, called for deleting any reference to specific numbers

 Peru proposed, and the CLAs agreed, to specify that the figures refer to the years 2011 and 2012, as they appear in the underlying report

 Responding to an enquiry from Zambia on the timeframe, the CLAs proposed, and participants agreed, to add a reference to the period 2008-2011

<p class="textstory">A paragraph on <strong>sector-specific and economy-wide policies </strong>was approved with a revision from Sweden specifying that economy-wide policies are “for the singular objective of mitigation

 On a sentence on cap and trade systems for GHGs being established in a growing number of countries and regions, Brazil stated that the trend may be the opposite, given the plunging carbon prices

” Switzerland, with Slovenia, disagreed, stressing that taxes mainly target fossil fuel combustion

<p class="textstory">Regarding a paragraph beginning with a sentence on “<strong>the reduction of fossil fuel subsidies achieving emission reductions at negative social cost, depending on the social and economic context</strong>,” Germany, Monaco and Canada questioned use of the term “negative social costs

 Canada and Germany said the qualifier referring to the social and economic context weakens the text and requested its deletion, while the authors preferred its retention

 Austria suggested including a footnote explaining that subsidies in many sectors affect GHG emissions, but that most of the recent literature has focused on fossil fuel subsidies

 Germany said the proposed revisions “watered down” the text and did not support the argument that fossil fuel subsidies should not be addressed here because the G-20 is addressing them

<p class="textstory">Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and Venezuela proposed deleting a sentence stating that since AR4, a small but growing body of literature based on economy-wide models has projected that complete removal of fossil fuel subsidies in all countries could result in significant reductions in global aggregate emissions by mid-century at negative social cost

 Germany, the UK, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Canada opposed

 Germany, supported by Norway, said they could accept including this text if the footnote specifying concrete numbers on projected emission reductions was retained

<p class="textstory">On a paragraph stating that: “<strong>within an appropriate enabling environment, the private sector can play an important role in mitigation</strong>,” Malaysia, supported by Bolivia, requested inserting text emphasizing the private sector’s role in generating emissions

 Bolivia underlined the private sector’s “complementary” role to that of the public sector

 The Maldives, supported by China, Venezuela, Brazil and Peru, called for retaining reference to the UNFCCC as the “primary” multilateral forum, while the US opposed singling out the Convention as the only multilateral climate change body

<p class="textstory"><strong>FIGURES AND TABLES: </strong>Figures and Tables were taken up in a contact group, co-facilitated by IPCC Vice-Chairs Jean-Pascal van Ypersele (Belgium) and Ismail El Gizouli (Sudan)

 Bolivia expressed reservations on: the IPCC’s scientific results, noting they prioritize economic rationality over social, collective and human values; using mitigation scenarios and analysis promoting carbon markets without adequately considering non-market based approaches; technologies proposed by the IPCC to promote mitigation actions, noting they are framed through the use of geoengineering based on CDR technologies, and that they violate Mother Earth’s right to naturally adapt to climate change, and affect the livelihoods and rights of local and indigenous peoples; and country categorization based on income in the underlying chapters, explaining that although this is accepted in the scientific literature, it is not appropriate for policymaking

<p class="textstory">Saudi Arabia, supported by Iraq, Venezuela, Malaysia, India, Egypt, Syria, Sudan and others, expressed concern about the acceptance of the WGIII report, expressing “substantial disagreement” on the use of income-based country groupings

 Saudi Arabia, the Bahamas, the Maldives, Qatar, and others also opposed country categorization based on per capita emissions

 Switzerland expressed his satisfaction with the SPM and emphasized the importance of preserving the scientific character of the process

 Austria called for keeping an open mind in light of the mitigation and adaptation challenges ahead

14), held in Yokohama, Japan, in March 2014 was approved

<p class="textstory">The Financial Task Team, co-chaired by IPCC Vice-Chair Ismail El Gizouli (Sudan) and Nicolas Beriot (France), presented their revised 2014 budget proposal and budgetary issues for the next three years

 Acknowledging the difficulties overcome and respect shown throughout the meeting, France stressed the need to move to a higher level of cooperation, and said he looked forward to the UNFCCC climate change conference in Paris in 2015

 Sweden, supported by China and Belgium, enquired about the IPCC’s capacity to accommodate the attendance of “potentially hundreds” of observer organizations, given the increased interest by the public in climate change issues

 Germany opposed this suggestion and, with Belgium, stressed the need for maintaining transparency and trust in the IPCC’s work

 Switzerland, supported by China and Peru, suggested that this issue be considered by the Task Group on the Future of the IPCC, while Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands said this should remain the task of the IPCC Bureau

 To this end, she proposed a workshop prior to IPCC-40, which was supported by the UK, Australia, Tanzania, Chile, Finland, India and others, with IPCC Chair Pachauri noting that the work of the Task Group will be extremely valuable for the Panel’s future

<p class="textstory">On the EAG’s finding of the Bureau members’ inherent conflict of interest, Brazil disagreed, noting that the IPCC is only complete with the endorsement of its scientific findings by governments

 Saudi Arabia and the Maldives expressed concern over the implications of the EAG’s finding for developing countries’ participation in the work of the Panel

 Observing that the COI Committee was established to look out for the IPCC’s best interests, Canada supported its actions and highlighted the importance of understanding the different roles people play at different times

 Germany requested more information on the kind of decisions to be taken on the basis of the EAG’s advice

 Norway, with Switzerland called for two international review processes, one prior to Paris and another carried out periodically thereafter

 The LDCs called for robust MRV of contributions and, with Colombia, for a compliance system comparable to the one under the Protocol

 China underlined it is “premature” to discuss compliance because of uncertainty about the 2015 agreement’s legal form

 Norway said the new agreement should be durable and include market-based mechanisms

 Ecuador said a “mitigation-centric” agreement would dilute other issues important to developing countries

<p class="textstory">On the<strong> legal form</strong>, Nauru, for AOSIS, and Belize, for CARICOM, said the agreement should be legally binding, with CARICOM calling for five-year commitment periods

<p class="textstory">On the<strong> structure of the agreement</strong>, the Marshall Islands, the US and Australia called for the core agreement to be concise and durable

<p class="textstory">On <strong><em>cross-cutting elements</em></strong>, Switzerland mentioned compliance, amendment of the agreement, annexes, and MRV, but said MRV should only be addressed in “horizontal chapters” when relevant for mitigation and adaptation in a similar manner

 South Africa and Japan mentioned transparency as a cross-cutting issue

 Japan called for testing the elements against durability: those that can survive for 10-20 years can go into the agreement, and those that are not durable should be addressed in decisions

<p class="textstory">On <strong><em>strengthening actions under workstream 2</em></strong>, Kuwait, for the G-77/China, called for balanced progress on both workstreams and for developed countries to enhance ambition by revisiting existing quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives, and through comparable efforts

<p>On the LMDCs proposal, China, for the LMDCs, highlighted their conference room paper (CRP) on workstream 2, calling for, <em>inter alia</em>: immediate and early ratification of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol; unconditional commitments by Annex I parties in 2014 to reduce emissions by 40% below 1990 levels by 2030; commitment of Annex II parties to support the adaptation framework; commitment to address response measures; rapid and substantial capitalization of the GCF; MRV of financial commitments; and operational modalities for the TEC and CTCN by SBSTA 42

<p>NORWAY, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and NEW ZEALAND said the LMDCs CRP goes beyond the Warsaw mandate, with AUSTRALIA saying implementation of the Bali Action Plan is addressed elsewhere

 CANADA added that the CRP would significantly limit parties’ collective ability to reduce emissions

 BRAZIL proposed considering expanding workstream 2 beyond 2020, either as part of the 2015 agreement or as a separate track

<p>SWITZERLAND, AUSTRALIA, NORWAY and NEW ZEALAND said TEMs should focus on enhancing mitigation ambition of all parties

 CANADA welcomed efforts to make TEMs more effective and engage subnational authorities, but cautioned that a web-based information portal could become unmanageable

 AUSTRALIA stressed ensuring the availability of financial resources

<p>NORWAY and JAPAN called for the TEC and CTCN to be more involved in the TEMs, with NEW ZEALAND suggesting they manage the TEMs and communicate TEM outcomes

 JAPAN called for maintaining a focus on technology

<p>SWITZERLAND and NORWAY said ministerial engagement should not be a matter of routine, but add value to the process

 NEW ZEALAND and VENEZUELA suggested providing ministers with focused questions

 BRAZIL and AOSIS warned against “ministerial fatigue

 AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, the EU, CANADA, SWITZERLAND and the US said the existing capacity-building framework is sufficient

 SWITZERLAND suggested building on existing institutions through COP decisions

 Tuvalu, for the LDCs, suggested a capacity-building institute and earmarking GCF funds for capacity building

<p>The EU, NEW ZEALAND, CANADA, NORWAY, AUSTRALIA, SWITZERLAND, the US and JAPAN said the MRV system should be applicable to all, with some in-built flexibility to respond to national circumstances

 SWITZERLAND added that the common MRV regime could be operationalized through COP decisions

 The EU, AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND called for key principles governing the rules for the land sector and markets, emphasizing, supported by Chile, for AILAC, the need to avoid double counting

<p>Underscoring that parties’ different commitments call for differentiated reporting, NORWAY suggested common principles in the 2015 agreement on, <em>inter alia</em>: rules for reporting emissions building on IPCC methodologies; common metrics; verification of GHG inventories; a common framework for LULUCF emissions, based on the best available knowledge; and rules and principles for carbon credit integrity

<p>AILAC and BANGLADESH emphasized building on the current MRV systems, with AILAC pointing to the rules under the Kyoto Protocol, taking into account diverse contexts and capacities, and suggesting MRV be used as a trigger for the compliance mechanism

 CHINA opposed addressing compliance together with transparency as in the Co-Chairs’ paper

<p>Emphasizing that “transparency is not a substitute for legal force” and that a detailed MRV system is being implemented already, SOUTH AFRICA, supported by BRAZIL, questioned the need for new rules and called for enhanced methodologies for MRV of support, with BRAZIL calling for using INDCs as a means to MRV support by including MOI

<p><strong>ADAPTATION:</strong> Franz Perrez, Switzerland, reported on the informal consultations on adaptation, highlighting emerging consensus on the need to bring forth and enhance existing commitments

<p>The sixth part of the second session of the <em>Ad Hoc</em> Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP 2-6) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) took place in Bonn, Germany, from 20-25 October 2014

 Switzerland and Norway said ministerial engagement should not be a matter of routine, but add value to the process

 New Zealand and Venezuela suggested providing ministers with focused questions

 Brazil and AOSIS warned against “ministerial fatigue

<p>The EU, Chile, Mexico, Mali and AOSIS welcomed workstream 2 as a tool to engage with non-state actors

 While noting the important role of non-state actors, Tanzania stressed the need to avoid mixing actions by parties and those by others

<p>On action on adaptation, Bolivia, for the G-77/China, and Iran called for recognizing that adaptation is country-specific

 The G-77/China, with Bangladesh, the African Group and Saint Lucia, described national adaptation plans (NAPs) as key in supporting adaptation

 Ecuador and Algeria suggested negotiating on the basis of the CRP submitted by the LMDCs

 Colombia, Saint Lucia, for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), and Switzerland, opposed by Tanzania, supported adopting an INDC decision in Lima

<p>On differentiation, Argentina, for the LMDCs, Sudan, for the African Group, and China suggested INDCs include differentiated information for Annex I, Annex II and non-Annex I parties

 Many cautioned against backsliding, with Brazil suggesting a “concentric” approach to differentiation, where countries with absolute reduction targets are at the center of concentric cycles of less rigorous commitments going outward, with every party encouraged to move towards the center over time

 Tuvalu, for the LDCs, and Kenya emphasized differentiation of information, especially for the most vulnerable

 Switzerland, New Zealand, Australia and Canada opposed a “bifurcated approach

 New Zealand, Canada, and the Russian Federation said INDCs should address mitigation only, with Switzerland and the US arguing that including adaptation in the INDCs would delay their submission

 Norway suggested including MOI needs for developing countries’ actions requiring international support

 Malawi also supported a quantitative commitment

<p>Switzerland, Canada, the US, Norway, New Zealand and Australia opposed a short-term quantitative goal in the post-2020 period

 Switzerland called for commitments by all countries to provide resources for climate change policies and, with the US and the LDCs, for all countries in a position to do so to provide support to those who require it

 Norway, with the EU, called for commitments from all parties, and pricing carbon

<p>Norway and Brazil called for moving away from project-based approaches to finance, with Norway clarifying their proposal builds on their REDD+ experience, with a step-wise approach to building readiness and capacity

<p>On institutional mechanisms, the G-77/China, Costa Rica, for AILAC, Chile, the LDCs, Turkey, Palau and the EU said the GCF should be anchored into the agreement

<p>The LMDCs, Algeria, China, Iran and India said public finance should be the major source of climate finance

 Ecuador suggested an “eco tax” on oil exports

<p>China, Iran, Ecuador, Palau and Tanzania said that private finance should be complementary, but not replace public finance

 Switzerland noted the importance of a diversity of sources

 Guyana, Ecuador, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Egypt distinguished between climate finance and official development assistance

 Chile and CARICOM called for a definition of climate finance

<p>Japan, Canada and the US stressed enabling private investment and low-carbon growth, with the EU and the US clarifying that private finance will not replace public finance

 Australia emphasized using public finance to support those unable to attract private finance, and prioritizing finance to those with the least capacity and greater vulnerability

 Bolivia opposed market-based approaches to climate finance

<p>The LDCs, the EU and the US, opposed by India, suggested considering South-South cooperation in the 2015 agreement

<p>On transparency of support, Kenya supported a review mechanism, and Mexico called for robust MRV

 Colombia and the LDCs supported <em>ex ante</em> assessment and <em>ex post</em> review of climate finance

<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Tuvalu, for the LDCs, proposed a legally-binding agreement and a system based on two annexes, including the possibility of making amendments for parties to increase their level of mitigation ambition through COP decisions

<p>Nauru, for AOSIS, Norway, the EU, Japan and Switzerland called for time-bound, binding mitigation commitments by all parties

 Norway stressed that additional action could be conditional on finance and support

 New Zealand cautioned against using considerable negotiation time on a global goal, whereas Chile, for AILAC, said agreeing on a global goal is key

<p>China, the EU, Norway and Switzerland called for provisions against backsliding

 China added that the agreement should “encourage, not force” developed countries to take action on mitigation

 Bolivia suggested a “compound index of country participation,” based on historical responsibilities, ecological footprint, capability and state of development

 Nigeria called for strong mitigation commitments from Annex II parties

 Brazil said self-differentiation “would not take us to an agreement,” and, supported by AILAC, suggested a “concentric” approach to differentiation

 Canada said that national determination of contributions resolves the difficulty of differentiation

<p><strong>Cycle: </strong>The LDCs, AOSIS, Belize, for CARICOM, Switzerland, Timor-Leste, the Marshall Islands and the US called for a five-year cycle

 Singapore suggested seven-year cycles

 Brazil, Japan, Jordan and the Republic of Korea supported a ten-year cycle, with the Republic of Korea calling for a mid-term review to accommodate parties’ capabilities

 Iran said discussing cycles is beyond the Durban mandate

<p>Drawing attention to the numerous existing cycles, China and Iran cautioned against adding cycles to the process

 New Zealand and Australia preferred setting a common cycle, with Australia suggesting phased cycles linked to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment cycles, including: <em>ex ante</em> and <em>ex post</em> MRV; and review of aggregate level

<p>On the review, China and Iran supported anchoring existing arrangements in the 2015 agreement, including the international consultation and analysis

 Switzerland, Chile, for AILAC, and South Africa supported a compliance mechanism

 Jordan proposed an <em>ex post</em> review for mitigation, adaptation and MOI

 AOSIS, Norway and the LDCs stressed that an <em>ex ante</em> assessment of INDCs is necessary to inform whether “we are on the right track” to achieve the 2°C goal, suggesting the Secretariat assess aggregate ambition

 Brazil proposed five-year contribution terms with an aggregate exercise to estimate the level of ambition in light of the 2°C goal

 China said the legal form would depend on the substance of the agreement

 Iran stressed the need to address response measures

<p><strong>TEM ON CARBON CAPTURE USE AND STORAGE:</strong> On Tuesday, 21 October, Ulrika Raab, Swedish Energy Agency, facilitated a TEM where Canada, the UK and the United Arab Emirates shared perspectives on carbon capture and storage (CCS) options, barriers and opportunities, and an expert panel of business representatives presented on CCS implementation and options for carbon usage

<p><strong>TEM ON ACTION ON NON-CO2 GHGs:</strong> On Wednesday, 22 October, Marta Pizano, Colombia, facilitated a TEM during which parties, institutions and businesses presented on policies, actions and collaborative initiatives at sub-national, national and international levels to reduce and limit emissions from methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases, in particular hydrofluorocarbons

<p>On additional meetings, Co-Chair Runge-Metzger noted general understanding on the need for at least two additional meetings of the ADP in 2015, informing that the first will take place from 8-13 February 2015, in Geneva, Switzerland

<p><strong>CLOSING STATEMENTS:</strong> Bolivia, for the G-77/China, Ecuador, for the LMDCs, Saudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, and Sudan, for the African Group, expressed dissatisfaction with the new iteration of the Co-Chairs’ draft text on INDCs, lamenting that it fails to reflect the views of all parties

 Australia, supported by the Russian Federation, expressed difficulty with moving to breakout groups, stressing the need to avoid operating in silos

 The EU and Australia, for the Umbrella Group, looked forward to further iterations of the non-paper on the elements for a draft negotiating text

 In Bonn, this trend was reflected in the large number of developing country groups intervening, as well as in some solitary interventions by individual parties, such as Palau, Timor-Leste and Tanzania, that usually rely on their coalition’s spokesperson to voice their positions

 The proposals by the Independent Alliance of Latin America and the Caribbean on formulating short- and longer-term goals for finance, and by Norway, on adopting a step-wise readiness-based approach to finance, also drew interest across groups

<p>The 40th session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-40) will meet from 27-31 October 2014 at the Tivoli Conference Center in Copenhagen, Denmark, to consider and finalize the Synthesis Report (SYR), which integrates and synthesizes the findings from the three Working Group (WG) reports

 The Panel elected the new IPCC Bureau, and reelected Rajendra Pachauri (India) as Chair

<p><strong>IPCC-30:</strong> During this session (21-23 April 2009, Antalya, Turkey), the Panel focused mainly on the near-term future of the IPCC and provided guidance for an AR5 scoping meeting, which was held in Venice, Italy, from 13-17 July 2009

<p>The 40th session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-40) met from 27 October - 1 November 2014 at the Tivoli Conference Center in Copenhagen, Denmark, to consider and finalize the Synthesis Report (SYR), which integrates the findings from the three IPCC Working Group (WG) reports

 The Panel adopted Working Group I’s (WGI) contribution on the physical science basis of climate change in Stockholm, Sweden, in September 2013, and Working Group II’s (WGII) contribution on climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability in March 2014 in Yokohama, Japan

 WGIII’s contribution on mitigation of climate change was adopted in April 2014 in Berlin, Germany

<p>On Monday, 27 October, Rasmus Helveg Petersen, Minister for Climate, Energy and Building, Denmark, opened IPCC-40

<p>Kirsten Brosbøl, Minister of the Environment, Denmark, emphasized the “chilling” reality of climate change, evident in impacts occurring globally at an increasing rate

 She noted extreme rainfall and flooding in Denmark, and said that while governments have the primary responsibility to act, everyone—business, NGOs and citizens—must come together and “do their part

 Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Bolivia reiterated their reservations concerning the WGIII report

 1), which was forwarded for consideration to the Financial Task Team, co-chaired by IPCC Vice-Chair Ismail Elgizouli (Sudan) and Nicolas Bériot (France)

<p>Saudi Arabia and Bolivia cautioned against reopening discussion on issues already agreed upon, and stressed the need for balance between policy-relevant issues, involving sustainable development, adaptation and mitigation

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION: </strong>Regarding a sentence stating that the SYR’s SPM follows the structure of the longer report, Bolivia, supported by Slovenia, questioned reference to the section heading on “Transformations and changes in systems” and, with Venezuela, Nicaragua and Saudi Arabia, stressed the need to reflect the concept of sustainable development in relation to transformation

” Addressing the box in the longer report, the UK, Australia, the US, Japan, Canada and the EU expressed reservations on using the authors’ text as a basis for discussion

 Norway, Sweden and Chile stressed the need to follow IPCC procedures and go through this text as had been done with the rest of the SPM, while Germany suggested taking the text back to the informal group

 Noting the late hour and stressing respect for the authors’ proposal, Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, Venezuela and China proposed acceptance of the text as presented

 IPCC Vice-Chair Jean-Pascal Van Ypersele (Belgium) explained the process leading to the text, emphasizing that while IPCC members had been consulted, only authors had had input into the written proposal

 Norway, Germany, Venezuela, China and Chile suggested another attempt at consensus, while Peru, the US, Australia, the UK and Saudi Arabia expressed regret at the loss of the information in the box, but supported its deletion

<p>On a paragraph noting that <strong>ocean warming</strong> dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, the Netherlands, supported by Norway and Germany, called for including Figure 1

 Switzerland, the US, Ireland and others felt that a proposed additional clause specifying that “a decrease of 0

 The US, supported by Norway, preferred referring specifically to acidity, while Norway proposed putting the technical text in a footnote, noting, with Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, the need to show that a 0

” The US and Germany objected to this, noting it was still too technical

 The UK, supported by the US, Belgium and Saint Lucia, but opposed by the Russian Federation, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, proposed adding a statement that “the current rate of ocean acidification is unprecedented in the last 65 million years

<p>On a sentence stating that over the last two decades the <strong>Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass, glaciers have continued to shrink almost worldwide, and Arctic sea ice and Northern Hemisphere spring snow cover have continued to decrease in extent</strong>, Norway proposed reflecting that the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have been losing mass “at an increasing rate

 Spain, with Mexico, requested including numbers on the changes in the cryosphere from Figure 1

<p>The UK, with France, noted a lack of balance between this sentence and a subsequent one addressing the trend of increased sea ice extent around Antarctica, stressing that what is happening in the Arctic is graver than in Antarctica, and proposed drawing more on the WGI SPM and quantifying the issue of sea ice in the two regions

<p>On a sentence stating that the <strong>rate of sea level rise</strong> <strong>since the mid-19th century has been larger than the mean rate during the previous two millennia</strong>, the Netherlands sought to reflect the acceleration of global mean sea level rise since 1901

 The Republic of Korea, China, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Saudi Arabia and India proposed deleting this panel, noting it was not relevant in this section

 Italy suggested indicating that the panel refers to major sources of emissions

 China suggested further consultations on the issue

 A small group, co-chaired by Katrine Krogh Andersen (Denmark), and Arthur Rolle (Bahamas), convened to further discuss this issue

” Austria, supported by Sweden, proposed giving this statement more prominence and it was moved to the beginning of the caption

 China, Norway, Sweden, the EU, Denmark, Canada, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Chile and others urged approval of the figure

 Following protracted discussions, Saudi Arabia said it could accept, in the spirit of compromise, the figure as amended by Austria

 Saint Lucia, opposed by Canada, proposed an additional sentence from the WGII SPM, stating that some risk from adverse impacts will remain for all levels of adaptation and mitigation

 New Zealand, opposed by Canada, proposed replacing reference to “evolutions” with “trajectories

” Norway preferred “pathways” or “realizations

 Brazil, Argentina and Japan questioned this proposal but agreed to it following the author’s explanation that referring to pathways of land use would be the best option

5), Canada, supported by Finland, Saint Lucia and the UK, proposed simplifying language by referring to “a stringent mitigation scenario” and “two intermediate scenarios

 China, with Saudi Arabia, suggested using approved language from WGI SPM instead, which states that any given level of warming is associated with a range of cumulative CO2 emissions, and, for example, higher emissions in earlier decades imply lower emissions later

 Participants agreed to the proposal by China and Saudi Arabia

<p>Brazil opposed the expression “will require” as too prescriptive, preferring a suggestion by Switzerland, Japan and others to refer to “is associated with” or “are characterized by

” Citing the need for balance, Saudi Arabia objected to including only data for a &gt;66% probability and, opposed by Norway, the UK, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Chile, Japan, Austria and others, called for also including equivalent information for &gt;50% and &gt;33% probabilities

 Norway, Denmark, the UK, Germany, Canada and many others agreed to the authors’ proposal, but Saudi Arabia disagreed

 Canada, Australia, the UK and South Africa called use of the term “secular” inappropriate in this context, and Ireland suggested replacing the term with “unexpected,” which was accepted

5, Japan requested specifying temperature ranges for the other RCP scenarios

6 </strong>containing panels<strong> on global average surface temperature change and on global mean sea level change</strong>, India asked to reflect data from 1950 onwards

 On the figure’s caption and title, the Netherlands requested reference to sea level “rise” instead of “change,” to reflect increases illustrated in the figure, which was approved

 Responding to a request by Saudi Arabia to add a disclaimer in the Figure’s caption on models’ potential deficiencies or uncertainty, WGI Co-Chair Stocker, with the Netherlands, noted that this concern is addressed by the terminology used, such as “multi-model means” and “likely ranges,” as in other approved figures and the underlying assessment

5,” Japan requested reflecting data for the other two RCP scenarios as well

 Germany, with Saint Lucia, said that the statement on a decrease in surface ocean pH for all RCP scenarios was misleading, and noted that under RCP2

5,” Canada questioned the statement’s appropriateness for this scenario

 Sweden suggested capturing the amount of sea ice reduction, but an author explained that raising these details in the SPM would result in a lack of balance

 Bolivia, with Venezuela, Chile, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Brazil, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, Argentina and Morocco, stressed the need to add reference to risks being “greater for people and communities with greater disadvantages,” with Venezuela calling for further emphasis on developing countries

 Switzerland signaled that these concerns are already addressed in the longer report

8</strong> (regional key risks and potential for risk reduction), Austria pointed to the limits of comparing risk levels across regions and, similarly, the difficulty of conducting a robust assessment of risks among countries

<p>The US, supported by the UK and opposed by Saint Lucia, Switzerland, the Bahamas and Austria, suggested moving a sentence stating that “greater rates and magnitude of climate change increase the likelihood of exceeding adaptation limits” to the section dealing with adaptation

 The Netherlands and Turkey raised concerns over the definition of risk, with the Netherlands suggesting defining it as “a combination of exposure to hazards and vulnerability,” and Turkey proposing referring to the “probability of climate change

 Switzerland and Norway stressed the importance of referring to the magnitude and rate of climate change, and Field proposed to do so in a subsequent sentence on rising magnitudes of warming and other changes in the climate system, which was approved with the addition of reference to rates of warming

” Switzerland, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Australia favored replacing “CO2” with “GHG” emissions

<p>The Netherlands, supported by the US, proposed inserting a new sentence on the <strong>determination of risk</strong>

<p>Regarding a sentence stating that <strong>plants cannot naturally move sufficiently fast to keep up with current and high projected rates of climate change in most landscapes,</strong> Canada, with Japan, suggested referring to “plant species” that cannot “migrate” fast enough, while the Netherlands suggested “seed plants

” After some debate and other textual suggestions by India and the Bahamas, participants agreed to text saying “most plant species cannot naturally shift their geographical ranges

<p>On a sentence stating that coastal systems are at risk from sea level rise, India suggested adding reference to low-lying areas, which was agreed

<p>On a sentence stating that “risk levels are not necessarily comparable across regions,” Austria proposed “especially across regions” in line with the WGII SPM, which was accepted after some discussion

7 (change in average surface temperature and average precipitation) for regional projections, as suggested by the Netherlands

9 </strong>titled<strong> “Climate change poses risks for food production,”</strong> which shows the projected global redistribution of maximum catch potential, Canada expressed concern over the underlying uncertainty due to the figure’s derivation from a single climate model, and requested that this be reflected in the caption

<p>On a sentence noting that <strong>climate change is expected to lead to increases in ill-health in many regions</strong>, “especially in developing countries with low income,” India, Saudi Arabia, the Bahamas and others noted that vulnerability was not necessarily linked to income in developing countries

<p>Regarding a paragraph on <strong>expected impacts of climate change in urban and rural areas</strong>, participants agreed to proposals from Ecuador to add landslides and from the Bahamas to add drought and air pollution to a list of risks in urban areas

<p>On a sentence stating that <strong>aggregate economic damages accelerate with increasing temperature</strong>, Japan, supported by Switzerland, proposed adding text noting that few quantitative estimates have been completed for additional warming of around 3<span dir="rtl"> </span><span dir="rtl"> </span><span dir="rtl"><span dir="rtl"> </span><span dir="rtl"> </span>°</span>C and above

 Following queries from Switzerland, supported by Morocco, participants accepted a suggestion from South Africa to specify that global economic impacts are “currently” difficult to estimate

 Participants agreed to a proposal from India to substitute “losses” for “damages

<p>Regarding a sentence on <strong>climate change indirectly increasing risks of violent conflicts</strong> in the form of civil war and intergroup violence by amplifying well-documented drivers of these conflicts, such as poverty and economic shocks, Venezuela, with Nicaragua, Bolivia and Ecuador, opposed reference to civil war

 Nicaragua said the sentence contained a political message and suggested deleting it

 Canada proposed alternative wording without reference to civil war and intergroup violence

 Chile said this sentence had nothing to do with scenarios, but rather with different response times in the climate system

 The EU, Norway, Belgium and others proposed language reflecting that CO2 remains in the atmosphere for a long time

 Following a request by Germany, authors proposed adding a sentence that substantial continued warming is expected if emissions remain high beyond 2100

 Belgium suggested, and participants agreed, to refer to “additional” instead of “continued” warming

 Norway, with the UK, Slovenia and others, questioned this deletion

 The authors, with Norway, the UK, Chile, Slovenia, Belgium, Germany, and others, and opposed by Saudi Arabia, proposed using a sentence from the WGI SPM instead, stating that “warming will continue beyond 2100 in all RCP scenarios except RCP2

 FUTURE PATHWAYS FOR ADAPTATION, MITIGATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT:</strong> Commenting on this section in general, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bolivia, and China expressed concern that sustainable development was not emphasized enough and requested use of approved language from WGIII

<p> Regarding the title of this section, Bolivia proposed replacing “Transformations and changes in systems,” with “Climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development

” Switzerland objected, favoring the original formulation, noting “transformation” is one of the new concepts introduced in AR5 and had already been communicated in the WG reports

1: Foundations of Decision-making about Climate Change: </strong>In reference to a headline statement on <strong>analytical approaches to inform decision making on limiting climate change and its effects</strong>, Bolivia requested inserting reference to “issues of equity, justice and fairness,” while Saudi Arabia noted the need to also refer to cultural values, among others

 After a reworking of the text by authors in line with a proposal by Brazil, participants agreed to an alternative formulation stating that: sustainable development and equity provide a basis for assessing climate policies; limiting the effects of climate change is necessary to achieve sustainable development and equity, including poverty eradication; and mitigation and adaptation raise issues of equity, justice and fairness

 Brazil and Norway cautioned against changing “carefully crafted text,” and the sentence was approved as presented

<p>Regarding a sentence on the risks of delaying mitigation, Saudi Arabia, supported by Venezuela, but opposed by Finland, proposed adding language on how this could undermine action to promote sustainable development

<p>Regarding a statement that <strong>no single best balance exists between mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts</strong>, the UK, supported by Finland, called for its deletion

 Bolivia, supported by Saudi Arabia, preferred noting that this statement should be considered in the context of sustainable development

 Finland, supported by South Africa, the EU and Italy, suggested using approved text that “these methods cannot identify” the single best balance

<p>China, with Venezuela, Bolivia, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, requested reference to international cooperation, with Brazil, China and Saudi Arabia adding that such cooperation must be perceived as equitable

 Venezuela proposed also referring to knowledge sharing and technology transfer

” India, with El Salvador, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and China, requested including reference to adaptation

 Brazil, with the EU, stated that adaptation does not possess the characteristics of a collective action problem

” Switzerland stressed the need to add some more nuanced language to avoid giving the impression that “all” mitigation actions can have negative impacts, and suggested stating that only “not well-designed” mitigation actions involve risks

<p>Regarding a sentence on <strong>mitigation and adaptation as complementary approaches for reducing risks </strong>of climate change impacts over different time scales, Bolivia requested bringing in WGII language to reflect that adaptation and mitigation take place in the context of sustainable development

 Sweden and Australia preferred maintaining the text as is, and the sentence was accepted as presented

<p>Regarding a statement that <strong>investments in mitigation can reduce climate change</strong> in the latter decades of the 21st century and beyond, Bolivia called for deletion of the reference to “investments,” noting it usually refers to financial transfers

<p>Regarding a sentence stating that <strong>limiting risks related to the Reasons for Concern</strong> (RFCs) implies a limit for future cumulative CO2 emissions, Saudi Arabia and Australia, opposed by Germany, France, the US, Spain, Saint Lucia and others, preferred referring to emissions from all GHGs

 Austria, with Spain, the UK, Italy, Brazil and China, proposed deleting reference to “future” before cumulative CO2 emissions, noting cumulative emissions represent the past and present as well

 Participants agreed to a request by Saudi Arabia to simplify the language for policymakers’ understanding, and to a suggestion by Canada to delete the reference to the iterative risk management framework, and approved the remainder of the sentence as presented

3: Characteristics of Adaptation Pathways: </strong>Regarding a headline sentence stating that “taking a longer-term perspective increases the likelihood that more immediate adaptation actions will also enhance future options and preparedness,” Switzerland proposed to add “in the context of sustainable development,” which was agreed

<p>Following a request by Bolivia regarding a sentence on the <strong>contribution of adaptation to the well-being of populations, the security of assets and the maintenance of ecosystem services</strong>, participants agreed to insert a reference to ecosystem “goals and functions

<p>Regarding a sentence on the <strong>importance of building adaptive capacity</strong> for effective selection and implementation of adaptation options, Germany, supported by China and Saudi Arabia, called for adding language on the need to integrate adaptation into all development planning

 Referring to a suggestion by authors to add approved text from WGII SPM stating that integration of adaptation into planning and decision making can promote synergies with development and disaster risk reduction, Saudi Arabia, with El Salvador and opposed by Canada, requested referring to “policy design” instead of “decision making,” noting that the statement is mainly addressed to governments and that the private sector’s involvement in adaptation is insignificant in his country

<p>Bolivia, supported by Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, said the SYR was “completely unbalanced,” with only three paragraphs on adaptation and four pages on mitigation

<p>Regarding a paragraph on <strong>transformations and how they can enhance adaptation and promote sustainable development</strong>, Bolivia noted that transformations do not occur in a vacuum and called for adding language from WGII’s SPM referring to countries’ own national visions and approaches

11),” China, with Bolivia and Saudi Arabia, requested that information on achieving the 2°C goal through scenarios reaching different CO2eq concentrations, with different confidence levels, be included as well

 Norway, Germany, Denmark, New Zealand, Chile, Slovenia, the EU and Sweden supported the sentence as presented

<p>Bolivia, with Nicaragua, restated their objection to accepting 2°C over the 1

 Brazil suggested that the same text be used in other conceptually similar parts of the SPM that had not yet been approved, but Chair Pachauri cautioned against duplication

 Regarding a proposed footnote stating that CDR methods carry side effects and long-term consequences on a global scale, many delegations, including the US, Australia, Canada, Norway and Slovenia, requested insertion of a qualifier to indicate that the statement may not apply to all CDR methods

 Bolivia pointed to shortcomings associated with these technologies, noting that they do not contribute to sustainable development

<p>Regarding a new sentence proposed by authors on <strong>non-CO2 forcers in the context of mitigation</strong>, the US, with Australia and Chile, supported a formulation stating that “mitigation of certain short-lived climate forcers can reduce the rate of warming in the short term, but will have a limited effect on long-term warming,” instead of an alternative formulation proposed by the authors stating that “long-term warming is driven mainly by CO2 emissions” and that “reducing emissions of SO2 would cause warming

 Norway, Chile, Canada, Austria and Australia requested deletion of the sentence, citing inaccuracies

 Canada proposed a new formulation stating that while reduction in emissions of certain short-lived climate gases and aerosols (e

 China stressed that this proposal does not sufficiently convey the uncertainty regarding the impacts of black carbon and might imply that black carbon can be mitigated independently, which would be misleading

 Following calls for its deletion, the author team, supported by Brazil, stressed that the sentence reflects a fundamental policy-relevant finding, noting it is the only instance in the SYR that compares possible non-CO2 and CO2 mitigation options

<p>Regarding a paragraph on <strong>mitigation costs under limited availability of technologies</strong>, Japan proposed adding nuclear and renewable energies from the WGIII SPM to a list of key technologies highlighted in a sentence on the limits of models in producing scenarios likely to maintain warming to below 2°C over the 21st century if key technologies are delayed

 Following further consultations between Japan, Germany and the authors, the Panel approved listing all the technologies from Table SPM

<p>Saudi Arabia, supported by the Russian Federation, Egypt, Jordan, Venezuela, India, Australia, the Maldives, the Republic of Korea and Pakistan, proposed text highlighting that <strong>mitigation scenarios may reduce revenues for fossil fuel exporters and that the availability of CCS would reduce the adverse effects of mitigation on the value</strong>, as stated in the WGIII SPM

 Denmark and Switzerland and others objected

 Sweden suggested that impacts on renewable energy producers should also be mentioned

<p>A sentence on mitigation policy possibly devaluing fossil fuel assets and reducing revenues was approved, but the UK, Sweden and Slovenia called for the deletion of a subsequent sentence on mitigation scenarios being associated with reduced revenues from coal and oil trade, noting it was repetitive

 The UK, EU, Germany, Sweden and Norway expressed concern regarding lack of balance in the report between environmental goals and the nature of other co-benefits and risks, particularly adverse side effects

 The authors, with Bolivia, Norway, Austria, Mexico and others, preferred “would” since the text specifically refers to large-scale SRM

 Brazil, Canada and the Russian Federation made suggestions to qualify the statement

<p>On a headline sentence stating that <strong>effective implementation depends on supporting policies</strong>, and can be enhanced through integrated responses that link adaptation and mitigation with other societal objectives, Brazil, with El Salvador, stressed the need to include a reference to the importance of international cooperation in addressing climate change

1: Common Enabling Factors and Constraints for Adaptation and Mitigation Responses:</strong> On a sentence stating that <strong>technological innovation and investments</strong> in green infrastructure and environmentally sound technologies can reduce GHG emissions and enhance societal resilience to climate change, participants agreed to, <em>inter alia</em>, delete reference to “green” infrastructure and refer to “environmentally sound infrastructure and technologies” instead, as requested by Brazil

<p>Following comments by Brazil, Saudi Arabia and China, participants agreed to an alternative formulation of a sentence stating that improving institutions as well as coordination and cooperation in governance can help overcome regional constraints associated with mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk reduction

2: Response Options for Adaptation: </strong>Referring to a sentence on adaptation experience accumulating across regions in the public and private sectors and within communities, Bolivia, supported by Chile and opposed by the EU, stressed the importance of adding reference to “indigenous and local knowledge systems and practices

<p>On a sentence stating that adaptation options exist in all sectors and regions, participants agreed to a proposal by Germany to specify that options exist with diverse “potential” and approaches

 Participants debated whether to keep this sentence, with Denmark, Chile, France and Costa Rica voicing support for it, and Saudi Arabia objecting to targeting the energy supply sector alone

 In response to a request from Japan, the caption was modified to clarify that scenarios included the full portfolio of mitigation options, while retaining mention that the scenarios also include CCS, as suggested by Saudi Arabia

 With other small amendments suggested by Germany and Saudi Arabia, the figure was agreed

4: Policy Approaches for Adaptation and Mitigation, Technology and Finance:</strong> This subsection was first addressed in an informal group, co-chaired by David Warrilow (UK) and Antonina Ivanova Boncheva (Mexico) on Wednesday afternoon and evening

 Following a proposal by the Maldives, with Bolivia, for including a reference to technology “transfer,” authors proposed, and participants agreed, to refer to “technology development, diffusion and transfer

” Austria proposed adding text stating that substantial emission reductions would require large changes in investment patterns

 Bolivia answered that, if Austria’s proposal were agreed, a reference to the need for “stronger international cooperation” would also be necessary

 Other delegates, including Brazil and the US, preferred the formulation proposed by the authors, which was then approved

<p>Regarding text proposed by the informal group stating that “<strong>international cooperation for supporting adaptation planning </strong>has received less attention historically than mitigation, but is increasing,” Nicaragua requested stating that international cooperation is still insufficient, to which WGII Co-Chair Field responded that this text had already been approved in the SYR longer report

 The Maldives proposed adding “and implementation” after “adaptation planning

<p>On language stating that “while local governments and the private sector have different functions, they are increasingly recognized as critical to progress in adaptation,” El Salvador, with Nicaragua, observed that the sentence does not correspond to reality as the private sector has played a secondary role in adaptation

 Pakistan, the EU and Chair Pachauri supported the sentence as presented

 Responding to a proposal by Austria, WGII Co-Chair Field suggested reflecting that functions “vary regionally,” which was agreed

<p>On a sentence listing examples of <strong>institutional approaches to adaptation</strong> involving multiple actors, Bolivia, with Nicaragua, requested deleting “payments for ecosystem services,” noting that it is only one of the many possible functions that ecosystems serve

 Switzerland requested that reference to an economic instrument, such as insurance, be added, which was accepted

” Bolivia requested adding that “international cooperation can play a constructive role in development, diffusion and transfer of knowledge and environmentally sound technologies” from the WGIII SPM

 The Maldives proposed referring not only to diffusion of technologies, but also to technology development and transfer

5: Trade-offs, Synergies and Interactions with Sustainable Development: </strong>On a headline sentence stating that <strong>climate change is a threat to sustainable development</strong>, Denmark, with Germany, called for adding text to provide a broader context on how mitigation and adaptation improve human well-being

 Bolivia, supported by Saudi Arabia, requested replacing the sentence with text stating that limiting the effects of climate change is necessary to achieve sustainable development and equity, including poverty eradication

<p>The authors proposed, and participants agreed, to add a paragraph on text from the WGII SPM to a paragraph on climate change threats as proposed by Norway during discussions in a small group on adaptation issues, stating that “delaying mitigation actions may reduce options for climate-resilient pathways and adaptation in the future,” and that “opportunities to take advantage of positive synergies between adaptation and mitigation may decrease with time, particularly if limits to adaptation are exceeded

 Brazil questioned why biological carbon sequestration was singled out

 Bolivia preferred using agreed terminology, including “food production,” and Saudi Arabia called for referring to water production as well

1</strong>, following proposals by Saudi Arabia and Chile, the constraining factor of “weak governance and institutional arrangements” was changed to “challenges in governance and institutional arrangements,” to keep the table in line with the SPM

 The Panel agreed to admit as observers Green Cross International, Association Carré Geo &amp; Environnment (Cameroon) and CARE International (Denmark)

 Morocco congratulated the Secretariat on the compilation work and the new communications dynamic and stressed the need to publicize the AR5 in developing countries

20 and welcomes the progress made in Lima, Peru, towards the implementation of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage; and</p> 

<p>Arriving in Peru, delegates were welcomed by a decidedly positive spirit

 As COP 20/CMP 10 President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal observed in his opening speech, prior to the Lima Conference, the world had received a number of “good signals” from the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Summit, the initial resource mobilization of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), “historic” announcements by several major greenhouse gas emitting countries, including the EU, the US and China, as well as momentum generated from the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report

 Following the adoption of the decision by the COP, Tuvalu, for the LDCs, made a statement requesting that it be recorded in the report of the meeting

 These events included the GCF initial capitalization, the EU’s announcement of its 2030 mitigation target and, in particular, the bilateral announcements by the US and China, on their respective mitigation targets for 2025 and 2030, as well as by the US and India, on expanded cooperation on climate change, including on phasing down HFCs

 For example, how CBDR and respective capabilities are defined in the Lima Call for Climate Action decision “in light of different national circumstances,” is a near-verbatim citation from the November joint announcement by the US and China

<p>In spite of parties arriving in Peru with different expectations and widely diverging views, at the end most felt that, in the words of the South African Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa, the Lima Conference managed to strike a “delicate balance between very difficult issues” and laid “a solid foundation” for work towards Paris

 A Financial Task Team (FiTT), co-chaired by Nicolas Bériot (France) and Amjad Abdulla (Maldives), was established and asked to report back to the plenary at the end of the meeting

7), with the Panel agreeing to admit three new observer organizations: Action Jeunesse pour le Développement (Republic of Congo); Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (Australia); and the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Indiana University (US)

<p>On SRs, Norway, supported by Belgium, Brazil, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, proposed that identification of SRs should begin as early as possible and, as feasible, be done in the context of all deliverables of the cycle

<p>Norway, the UK, South Africa, Slovenia and others supported the concept of rapid updates, particularly in order to meet the UNFCCC’s needs, although others, including Brazil, the US and Mali, expressed concerns, including on how to carry them out credibly and accurately, the frequency of availability of new information, review procedures and the additional workload for authors

 WGI Co-Chair Thomas Stocker, supported by China, South Africa and Belgium, noted that the term “rapid” was not clear

 Pakistan, supported by Brazil, suggested addressing this together with SRs

 The Netherlands, supported by Brazil, recommended developing an online database and methodology to provide flexible and comparable regional information and climate models

 WGI Co-Chair Stocker, supported by Belgium, questioned the definition of “region,” and noted that any new IPCC product must maintain the IPCC elements of scoping, review and final approval

 The Russian Federation, supported by Germany, lamented the increase in the IPCC workload that would be required for regional reports

<p>Brazil, South Africa, Nicaragua, Mexico and the Maldives stressed the need for additional language, including on: the inclusion of local communities and indigenous peoples; and evidence gathering, such as from workshops, on highly vulnerable areas that do not have peer-reviewed literature, but this was not accepted

<p>Chile and Tanzania noted that the proposed paragraph on regional aspects had come about due to gaps in the AR5 WGII report and preferred strengthening regional aspects of the AR

<p>Germany, supported by Egypt, favored scoping of SPMs rather than the full report, noting it would enable a more focused and decreased workload

 WGI Co-Chair Stocker, supported by Sweden and Norway, noted that the SPMs have never been scoped since they are integral parts of the full ARs, and proposed scoping of SYRs, as well any cross-cutting issues

 Belgium suggested that a staggered approach would enable the IPCC to capture the attention of the media for a longer period of time

 Also favoring a staggered approach, the Maldives highlighted its capacity constraints to comment on reports within one year

<p>Supporting this text, Germany noted he would be open to changing the sequence of the WG reports, with El Gizouli responding that the sequencing would be decided during the scoping meeting

<p>China preferred extending the timeline to 18 months, while Slovenia favored keeping the timeline under 18 months

<p>Noting that the text was unclear and that such a decision could be taken at any point in the future, the UK, opposed by Germany, the Netherlands, Ecuador and others, suggested deleting the paragraph

<p>After further discussion on precise language, the Panel agreed to a proposal by Belgium, with slight amendments, stating that the IPCC “will consider developing methodology reports or good practice guidance reports, for example, to facilitate the preparation of regional and/or national scientific assessments

<p>On <strong>further exploring ways to enhance collaboration with other relevant international organizations and assessment bodies</strong>, including producing reports in partnership with those bodies, Japan sought to include regional and international research organizations or networks in a list of possible partners, given that some of these organizations support capacity building of scientists in various regions

 A call by India and the Maldives to include national bodies was ultimately not accepted

 The UK and Peru preferred reference to “scientific” rather than “research” organizations, which was ultimately accepted

<p>The Netherlands sought reassurance that jointly produced reports are fully compliant with IPCC rules and procedures

<p>Following agreement to delete reference to collaboration on Technical Papers, Saudi Arabia, with Brazil, the Maldives and Tanzania, also suggested deleting language “specifying production of reports” in partnership with other bodies, including a list of such bodies

 Switzerland, supported by Dominica, Tanzania, the US, Saudi Arabia and the Maldives, opposed specifying the nature of the collaboration, noting it was too limiting

 The US, supported by Norway, called for engaging specialists throughout the drafting period

 Canada, supported by the US, noted the need to involve both communications specialists as well as scientific writers

<p>Norway, supported by the Netherlands, called for a clear decision on the engagement of communications specialists at IPCC-41

 Brazil opposed the draft decision as amended by Canada and called for consideration of WGI Co-Chair Stocker’s proposal, which: eliminated the focus only on the SPM; and called for seeking advice from various specialists to enhance the readability of IPCC products

 The US, Japan and Canada preferred using existing committees and networks to improve access to non-English language literature rather than establishing new ones, while the Republic of Korea opposed limiting such committees to those currently in existence

<p>On the third point, the US, with Germany, Canada and Switzerland, opposed by Egypt, objected to a full translation of the literature assisted by a UN-based language service, questioning the necessity and the cost of such translations

 Brazil and others opposed reference to authors of such literature being approached to provide expert opinion or specific inputs on relevant topics

<p>Saudi Arabia, supported by India, the Republic of Korea, the Maldives and China, proposed increasing the number of Asian Bureau members from five to seven

<p>Egypt, supported by Algeria, proposed to increase the number of African representatives in the Bureau from five to seven

 Peru, supported by Brazil and Canada, expressed support for maintaining the current structure

 Ethiopia noted that the WMO’s Executive Committee has 37 members and called for adhering to this

 Canada objected to the “self-serving nature” of certain countries’ proposals and their own regions’ support for those proposals

 Egypt expressed discomfort with some delegations stating that its proposal was self-serving, which would suggest such proposals had no merit or reasoning to support them

 The Maldives noted that Asia contains the majority of the global population and is the most complex and diverse region

 Canada, supported by France, proposed that Asia and Africa clarify why they are asking for increased Bureau representation prior to the informal group meeting

 France noted that IPCC work and approval sessions are very unbalanced, but that Bureau representation has nothing to do this

<p>Voicing discomfort with the procedures, Nicaragua said that the Bureau could have added one more member from his region

 The Netherlands expressed serious concern with the lack of rationale on the size of the Bureau and asked to have his serious reservations recorded in the meeting report

<p>The Netherlands, opposed by the Central African Republic, speaking for the African region, Madagascar, Mali, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, called for adding language reflecting that this would not prevent a possible decrease in Bureau size in the future

 As an alternative, the Netherlands suggested reopening the preamble to the decision to state that “the IPCC strives to work efficiently and to reduce costs as far as possible

 Switzerland highlighted the need to revisit and strengthen the mandate in conjunction with the role of the DDC

 Germany and others proposed revisiting this issue at IPCC-43 on the basis of an updated TGICA vision paper that takes into account the views of governments, experts and observers

<p>The US, Canada and Belgium expressed concern regarding duplication of TGICA’s functions, such as with the WMO’s Global Framework for Climate Services, and recommended also discussing this issue further

<p>South Africa, supported by Tanzania, asked that language on strengthening implementation of TGICA be included in the text

 Switzerland, Germany, Japan and others objected to this inclusion, noting it was premature to add such language before a decision was reached on the TGICA’s mandate

 South Africa and Tanzania supported the need to strengthen implementation before discussing mandate

<p>To foster dialogue between TGICA and its data users, Canada, supported by several other countries, proposed organizing an expert meeting prior to IPCC-43

 Brazil proposed that such an expert meeting maintain an open format, noting that a workshop may be more appropriate

 Germany and the US objected to establishing additional TSUs, with Germany stating that this would depend on funding organizations and host countries

<strong> </strong>South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Venezuela, Mali, Brazil and others disagreed, and stressed the need to maintain reference to additional TSUs, noting that many developing countries favor the establishment of TSUs in developing countries

<p>Responding to a query by Germany and the US, Acting Chair El Gizouli and Secretary Christ explained that establishing additional TSUs was a common IPCC practice, and recalled the establishment of TSUs for the AR5 SYR and for the LULUCF SR

 The US, with Japan, Germany and Norway, but opposed by Saudi Arabia, called for deleting reference to MoUs

 Germany, supported by WGII Co-Chair Field, supported clarifying the roles but opposed prescribing this through an MoU, with several delegations noting potential legal implications with an MoU

 Switzerland said someone must be in charge of TSU/Secretariat arrangements

<p>The US, supported by Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands, Japan, Germany and Belgium, proposed alternative language encouraging the Secretariat and the TSUs to engage in dialogue on respective roles and responsibilities and to periodically report on this matter to the Panel

 Brazil preferred more emphatically “requesting” the Secretariat and others to explore options for arrangements to enhance the clarification of roles

 Japan noted that the content of any arrangement could be discussed when TSU host countries are decided at IPCC-42

<p>The UK, supported by Norway, cautioned that the US language might be perceived as indicating disagreement between various IPCC bodies, and suggested that the Panel be “kept informed about working arrangements between the IPCC Secretariat and TSUs, and among TSUs

” Brazil supported the UK’s proposal, with the inclusion of a request for periodic reporting to the Panel

<p>After further discussions, Australia proposed language requesting the IPCC Secretariat and the TSUs to periodically report to the Panel on the collaboration, roles and responsibilities in the preparation of the AR6

 Egypt, supporting Mali, proposed language calling for diversity and broadened representation in the TSUs

<p> Japan, supported by Germany, New Zealand and the US, cautioned that the involvement of the IPCC Chair and Secretariat would introduce complications in staff recruitment and management processes, and called for transparency on recruitment

<p>Many developing countries, including Egypt, South Africa, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Ecuador, Iran, Algeria, Brazil, India, Syria, Madagascar, Malaysia, the Maldives, El Salvador, Chile and Malawi, spoke strongly in favor of the second option, noting that the current arrangement does not allow for equal footing for both Co-Chairs

 Brazil called for maintaining reference to the IPCC Trust Fund regarding funding for this option

<p>Norway, Japan, the Republic of Korea and others agreed on the merits of the second option, but, with TFI Co-Chair Taka Hiraishi, questioned its feasibility, given the need for a clear and sustainable decision on arrangements to be in place before IPCC-42

<p>Querying where financing would come from for the second option, whereby the TSU could be comprised of both developing and developed country institutions, the US, with Canada and others, preferred the first option, with the TSU hosted and managed by the country of the developed country WG/TF Co-Chair

 Canada called for further specifying that WG TSU candidates can only be nominated if they have adequate resources

<p>Citing its experience with AR5 WGI, China pointed to improvements already made in the support received by developing country Co-Chairs from the TSU, called for a continuation of the progress made so far, and stressed the importance of stable funding

<p>Canada, South Africa and China, opposed by Japan and the Republic of Korea, suggested deleting the option based on IPBES, stating that IPBES is untested as a model

 Egypt, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Madagascar and others called for something stronger than “encourages” assistance, and participants agreed to “requests

 The US, supported by Germany and Switzerland, opposed any financial incentives, arguing that this would change the IPCC’s character, although the US supported exploring how more comprehensive support could be provided

 Switzerland suggested broadening the reference to simply exploring, as appropriate, possible approaches for allowing extended participation

 WGI Co-Chair Stocker, supported by Norway, noted that some countries have provided different forms of assistance and suggested exploring ways to provide financial “or operational assistance,” in recognition of the burden of a comprehensive assessment

 Japan objected, arguing that scientific capacity-building activities are not within the IPCC’s mandate

<p>Discussion coalesced around two alternative proposals: IPCC Vice-Chair van Ypersele proposed that the IPCC “explore the possibility of providing adequate support and access to scientific literature to CLAs and LAs who need it to do their IPCC work,” while WGI Co-Chair Stocker, supported by Norway, proposed to encourage IPCC members “to explore ways of enhancing the assistance to CLAs and LAs in recognition of the increasing burden of a comprehensive assessment

<p>Switzerland and New Zealand, opposed by Egypt, cautioned that “support” and “assistance” generally imply financial support or assistance

 The US suggested specifying adequate “technical and administrative” support, with Dominica adding “financial” to that list

 Egypt preferred to retain a reference to “adequate support

<p>Tanzania, with Egypt, supported IPCC Vice-Chair van Ypersele’s wording and requested qualifying CLAs and LAs with those “particularly in developing countries

” Van Ypersele noted that authors in developed countries also sometimes have difficulties, although Egypt, supported by South Africa and Saudi Arabia, noted that this phrase would not limit assistance only to developing countries

 The Netherlands suggested changing the term to “low-income” countries but Peru responded that no “low-income” category exists in IPCC procedures

<p>The US, supported by Tanzania, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia, suggested combining the two proposals into a one referring to the IPCC exploring ways to provide enhanced technical and administrative support, including access to scientific literature, particularly to developing country CLAs and LAs, in recognition of the increasing burden of a comprehensive assessment

 Following informal consultations, Egypt proposed qualifying financial assistance to developing country CLAs and LAs for those “who require it

” The Netherlands said it could accept this proposal, and the US compromise language was agreed with this amendment

<p><strong>Additional Measures to Attract Qualified Experts from Developing Countries and Enhance and Facilitate their Engagement with the IPCC:</strong> Germany recommended clarifying that these were additional measures that could be explored, and cautioned against entering into too much detail in the recommendations

<p>The US, supported by the EU, Norway and others, suggested increasing the proportion of meetings in developing countries

 The Netherlands supported using IPCC meetings to spread knowledge about climate change, while being cognizant about the carbon footprint associated with more meetings in developing countries

” Switzerland proposed new language that highlighted the need to increase IPCC activities in developing countries

<p><strong>Options for Support and Training of (Young) Scientists, while Reaffirming that Training and Capacity Building is Outside the IPCC’s Mandate:</strong> Peru noted the various options in this section were simply a compilation of proposals and did not need to be discussed in detail or negotiated to conclusion, as they were beyond the IPCC’s mandate

 Germany proposed including this section in the report of the meeting and not as a decision

<p>Noting the decision taken to maintain a 5-7 year cycle for the AR6, Canada, supported by Germany, the US, Norway and Ethiopia, opposed specifying an end date and suggested that the term of the Bureau not be longer than seven years

<p>Switzerland, with Belgium and Egypt, supported the Secretariat’s proposal of a specific end date, noting that governments want clarity on issues that have budgetary implications

 Mali cautioned against preempting the length of the cycle

 This proposal was supported by Switzerland

 WGIII Co-Chair Sokona, Chair of the expert meeting, reported on the meeting, which took place from 28-29 January 2015 in Geneva, Switzerland, and provided an overview of the outcomes

 Brazil read a statement for inclusion in the report of IPCC-41, welcoming the recommendations and, <em>inter alia</em>: noting that any process should consider equal opportunities for social scientists from developing countries; cautioning against constraining developing country participation; emphasizing confidentiality as key for any researcher studying the IPCC; and supporting a continuation of discussions on this issue

 He also said that if hosting the workshop, Brazil would organize outreach events for secondary school children and climate change experts at large, to convey WGI and WGII findings

 The Netherlands also offered to host the workshop

<p>Following consultations between the Netherlands and Brazil, the Netherlands reported that Brazil would host the meeting, with major contributions from the Netherlands

 TFI Co-Chair Krug thanked the Netherlands for agreeing to jointly organize the workshop in Brazil

 Algeria proposed a special report on the link between climate change and desertification

<p>Madagascar, Chad, Egypt, Mali, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Spain, the Philippines, Kuwait and others supported both proposals

<p>On a special report on desertification, Peru highlighted synergies with the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and scope for collaboration

 India called for an integrated special report on oceans and desertification, highlighting their linkages

 Malawi recommended addressing tropical cyclones and extreme weather events in the oceans report

<p>Many members, including Canada, Republic of Korea, Norway, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, the US and others suggested further consideration of these proposals in light of the AR6 scoping process

 Belgium called for an expert meeting to consider these issues

<p>Norway, supported by Sweden, proposed inviting proposals from governments on additional themes for SRs

 He described a workshop held in Nairobi, Kenya, just prior to the convening of IPCC-41 for students and scientists as an example of ongoing outreach activities

 France noted the intense activity on climate policy and communications expected during the second half of 2015

 She noted that Prince Albert II of the Monaco Foundation and the Cuomo Foundation would continue to provide funding for the third round

23), WGII Co-Chair Field said the meeting was on track as scheduled for 27-29 May 2015 in Dublin, Ireland, and that the expert meeting outcome would inform the Panel on its future products

<p>Argentina, with Mali and Nicaragua, called for a greater emphasis on adaptation

 Cuba and the Dominican Republic called for consideration of the special circumstances of small island developing states and their vulnerable food systems

 Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Cuba called for greater participation by developing countries in the organization of the expert meeting

 He reported that the meeting will be held from 18-20 May 2015, in Laxenburg, Austria

 Ireland countered that in his view the Panel had acted appropriately given the recent unusual set of circumstances

<p>The US, supporting Ireland, noted that the IPCC is a unique organization with unique election rules, so it is not possible to foresee every circumstance that may occur

 He agreed with Saudi Arabia that the decision in this case appeared appropriate, but supported Ireland on the desirability of a comprehensive review of all Rules of Procedure

<p>Secretary Christ announced that IPCC-42 would take place from 5-8 October 2015 in Dubrovnik, Croatia, followed by a meeting of the newly elected Bureau on 9 October

 INDONESIA said the section should not rewrite or reinterpret the Convention

<p>LDCs, supported by SWITZERLAND, suggested first working on the various options within paragraphs before attempting to merge paragraphs

<p>Emphasizing the need to allow time for group coordination, Bolivia, for the G-77/CHINA, suggested addressing sections of the text thematically and, supported by Jamaica, for AOSIS, beginning with streamlining the text on monitoring and evaluation

<p><strong>Mitigation: </strong>Chaired by ADP Co-Chair Ahmed Djoghlaf (Algeria) the ADP negotiating group on mitigation considered consolidation of several paragraphs in the Geneva negotiating text

<p>The consolidation of paragraphs 30 and 32 referencing regional economic integration organizations and joint implementation of commitments was not agreed upon, as TUVALU opposed this, explaining it would create unnecessary complications

5 was not agreed upon, as BOLIVIA opposed, emphasizing the need to keep paragraph 38 separate as it relates to the Warsaw Framework for REDD+

 India, for the G-77/CHINA, said 132

1 on institutional arrangements for technology development and transfer, INDIA cautioned against interpretive approaches to consolidation, preferring mechanical streamlining, with TUVALU agreeing that the proposed consolidation of 133 and 133

<p>The EU, opposed by Argentina, noted that the substantive text applicable to “all” parties was being streamlined while numerous options referring to developed countries remained in the text, underscoring this could be an unbalanced approach

<p><strong>Finance:</strong> Co-facilitator Franz Perrez (Switzerland) provided a status update on the facilitated group session on mitigation held on Monday, 1 June

 ZAMBIA noted these proposals reflect the group’s consensus but explained the LDCs may still make additions

 A number of developing countries, including BOLIVIA, SOUTH AFRICA and Belize, for AOSIS, presented additional textual proposals or brackets to the G-77/China proposals

<p>NORWAY, the EU and SWITZERLAND commended the consolidations as useful while noting that, wherever new language is introduced, they reserve the right to come back to text

 She suggested, opposed by the EU and NORWAY, deleting paragraphs 82

 KENYA and INDIA agreed with focusing on options with similarities that could be merged

 The proposed consolidation of options 1 and 7 in this paragraph was opposed by CHINA, who noted the options contain separate ideas, with differentiation based on type of contribution on the one hand, and based on classification of countries on the other

 Several parties, including BRAZIL, TUVALU, ARGENTINA and MEXICO, suggested conceptual issues should be discussed at ADP 2-9 without the expectation of being resolved

 INDIA and CHINA called for remaining focused on streamlining text

 With AUSTRALIA and NORWAY, the US proposed identifying what should go in the agreement and what should go in decisions

<p>On paragraph 152, on arrangements for elaborating rules and modalities, SWITZERLAND suggested merging options a and b under option 1 sub-paragraph g on recognizing the use of market mechanisms

<p>On institutional arrangements for capacity building, China, for the G-77/CHINA, agreed to present a consolidation proposal for options a and b under paragraph 140

<p>SOUTH AFRICA, supported by BRAZIL and SAINT LUCIA, and opposed by KAZAKHSTAN and BELARUS, proposed deleting option 4, which states that Article 3

<p>SAINT LUCIA, opposed by TURKEY, BELARUS and KAZAKHSTAN, proposed also deleting option 1, which states that Article 3

 Argentina, for the G-77/CHINA, called for the continuation of the forum on response measures and for further discussions of enhanced action on response measures

 The US, with AUSTRALIA, proposed not limiting discussions to the draft decision forwarded from Lima

 SINGAPORE emphasized the need for an institutionalized mechanism to systematically address response measures

<p>SBI Chair Amena Yauvoli proposed, and parties agreed to, informal consultations, co-facilitated by Eduardo Calvo (Peru), Delano Ruben Verwey (the Netherlands) and Crispin D’Auvergne (Saint Lucia)

 CHINA and SAUDI ARABIA called for a procedural outcome

 JAPAN and CANADA stressed the importance of the technical summary of the SED report

<p>On the content of the draft decision, AOSIS, supported by the LDCs, BOTSWANA and Colombia, for AILAC, said the decision should call for strengthening the long-term global goal to 1

 INDIA, supported by BOTSWANA and BHUTAN, pointed to the need to address information gaps

 Brazil said a general anchoring provision avoids duplication of existing institutions

</p> <p>On whether provisional application should be the subject of an explicit provision in the agreement or be left for the decision adopting the agreement, Australia, Norway, Canada and AILAC supported the latter

 India and New Zealand proposed deleting the text on provisional application

</p> <p>On duration of the agreement, AILAC, the EU, AOSIS, the US, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Angola, New Zealand and Japan did not see a need for an end date of the agreement

 Mali for the G-77/China, Saudi Arabia for the LMDCs, China and Brazil noted the draft elements lacked specific actions, calling on parties to go beyond general requests for “enhanced” action

</p> <p>Proposing the appointment of three co-champions to raise political visibility, Maldives, for AOSIS, suggested three steps: connecting technical work and political cooperation; scaling up the work of the Convention bodies; and continuing the work undertaken by the COP Presidency

</p> <p>While recognizing the importance of high-level engagement, Mexico cautioned that it alone would not catalyze the action sought

</p> <p>China and Kuwait, for the Arab Group, recalled earlier COP decisions that call on workstream 2 to address issues outside mitigation, such as adaptation and MOI

 India urged parties to think of the pre-2020 gap in terms of all these elements

 With the US and Australia, he clarified that while the issues other than mitigation are important, they should be addressed in the right fora by the relevant experts

</p> <p>New Zealand and Switzerland urged “fixing” other bodies if deemed inadequate before creating new institutions

 Brazil, China and Iran highlighted that workstream 2 is as important as, and complements, workstream 1, noting that agreement on workstream 2 underpins an effective Paris agreement

 Several developed country parties and Colombia, for AILAC, welcomed the emphasis on the role of non-state actors

<p><strong>INTERACADEMY COUNCIL (IAC) REVIEW:</strong> In response to public criticism of the IPCC related to inaccuracies in AR4 and the Panel’s response to the criticism, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and IPCC Chair Rajendra Pachauri (India) requested the IAC to conduct an independent review of IPCC processes and procedures and to present recommendations to strengthen the IPCC and to ensure the quality of its reports

 Following the resignation of IPCC Chair Pachauri, Ismail El Gizouli (Sudan) was appointed Acting IPCC Chair pending the election of a new Chair at IPCC-42

 He noted vulnerabilities to climate change in Kenya and highlighted the Government’s efforts to mainstream climate change into national development planning

<p>Achim Steiner, UNEP Executive Director, in his last message to the IPCC in this capacity, praised Kenya for its pioneering role on the front lines of climate change mitigation

 The Panel adopted the report with editorial changes proposed by Belgium

 The Financial Task Team (FiTT), co-chaired by New Zealand and Maldives, convened throughout the meeting, and presented the revised decision (IPCC-XLIII/CRP

<p>During discussions, the US, Canada, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Norway, Belgium and others expressed concern about this situation and called for targeted outreach undertaken at high levels, including by the heads of WMO and UNEP, with IPCC Chair Lee leading the effort

 Japan welcomed the Secretariat’s suggestion to look into diversifying sources of income, but stressed the importance of the IPCC remaining neutral and independent

 Brazil cautioned against private resources and said that, while some philanthropic organizations can be helpful for some activities, the core budget should be driven only by the Panel

<p>WGII Co-Chair Hans-Otto Pörtner noted that budget negotiations are nearly finalized for their TSU, saying it will be hosted by the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, in Potsdam, Germany, with operations also taking place in South Africa

<p>Saint Lucia, Norway, Germany, the UK, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Spain, the US, New Zealand, Japan, France, Solomon Islands, Hungary, Chile, the EU and others opposed Saudi Arabia’s suggestions, and urged keeping the language simple and leaving the content to the scoping process

 Brazil expressed surprise at the resistance to referring to sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty

<p>The US, Norway and Canada stressed that the IPCC historically operates differently than the UNFCCC negotiations and should remain a collegial body focused on overcoming problems and finding solutions

<p>On the <strong>land use cluster, </strong>Australia, Japan, Austria, Senegal, Chad, Canada, Singapore, Iran, Indonesia, Norway, Russian Federation and Venezuela, among others, supported an SR in this area

 Hungary, Luxembourg and Mauritius also voiced support for this option if a third SR were possible

 Saudi Arabia, Iran, Jordan and Brazil emphasized a particular focus on desertification and land degradation

 The Solomon Islands suggested the SR also treat peatland degradation and fires, and Switzerland supported examining mountains

 Norway, the UK, Hungary, Chile, Austria and others, opposed by Brazil, called for referencing forests

<p>A drafting group, facilitated by New Zealand and Venezuela, refined the focus of the cluster on land use to be “climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management and food security

 Monaco voiced strong support, offering funding

 France called for the oceans SR to include aspects like coastal towns, infrastructure, sea-level rise and food security

<p>On <strong>cities</strong>,<strong> </strong>Australia, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Hungary, Pakistan, Denmark and others expressed interest in an SR in this area

 Norway noted that such a report would be an innovative endeavor for the IPCC, with the potential to reach new audiences and stakeholders

<p>Cognizant of continued support for all the topics and the need to limit SRs to no more than three, the US, Saint Lucia, Solomon Islands, Maldives, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Luxembourg, Indonesia, Mexico, the EU, Germany and Venezuela supported undertaking the land use and oceans and cryosphere SRs during AR6 cycle, emphasizing cities in AR6, and flagging an SR on cities for the AR7 cycle

<p>Following adoption, Brazil offered to host the development of the 1

 Germany, France, Saint Lucia, the UK, Norway and the US indicated this proposal would require careful consideration, highlighting that the development of SRs rests with the WGs

<p>Belgium, supported by Luxembourg, Chile, Sudan, Maldives, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Norway, suggested the Bureau consider ways to fix the appropriate size of the different IPCC products, including SRs, noting length “inflation” over time

 Madagascar, Russian Federation, Brazil and Venezuela preferred not having a stand-alone volume on regional aspects

 Canada, supported by many, called for moving the AR6 scoping process forward and for it to take place as soon as possible to give further time for scientists to work on substantive aspects of the report

<p>The US, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Cuba, China and others opposed reducing expert and government review periods from eight weeks to six weeks in the AR6 cycle

 The US and Norway supported early AR7 elections before the end of the AR6 cycle

 Norway called for electing the IPCC Chair even earlier and separate from Bureau elections

<p>Norway, the UK and Hungary requested preparation of a revised detailed timetable reflecting how all three SRs and AR6 fit together

<p>Japan, the UK, Argentina and Germany, opposed by Norway, supported producing a single methodology report instead of a series

 Responding to Germany, IPCC Chair Lee confirmed the decision on the number of reports would be made after the scoping meeting

<p>During discussions, Finland noted the possible need for new types of data approaches, particularly in light of regional reports

 Canada supported maintaining or enhancing DDC work over other TGICA activities

 With the UK and France, he called for prioritizing the work of the DDC, not expanding the TGICA mandate, and using the WG TSUs to coordinate the DDC

 Switzerland called for elaborating a clear vision containing guiding principles, rather than a decision focusing on very specific elements

 Norway said it should not be earlier than 2017, noting that lead author meetings are split by WG and so holding the Expert Meeting in conjunction with them would be complicated

 Norway said communication skills could be considered as one factor in author selection

<p>In response to Belgium, IPCC Chair Lee explained the review would result in recommendations on the Programme’s Board of Trustees at IPCC-44

<p>During discussion, the US, with Canada, urged applying the policy only to academic researchers, adding that if other types of requests are received, revision of the policy could be considered at that time

 Switzerland noted the broad range of stakeholders beyond academics that are interested in the process, suggested considering how to protect the personal reputations of those involved in the process, and raised the potential need for an appeals process

 He announced that the post has been offered to and accepted by Abdallah Mokssit (Morocco), and expects this appointment will be finalized shortly

 France suggested this be considered first by the Bureau

<p>The Panel agreed that IPCC-44 will be held in the second half of October, in Geneva, Switzerland, or Vienna, Austria, pending availability of conference facilities

<p>Barely four months after the Paris Agreement was adopted, and with a whole new Bureau only six months into its job, the IPCC reconvened in Nairobi, Kenya, for its 43rd session

 France and Morocco pledged to increase their financial contributions to the IPCC and/or in-kind contributions

 Sweden, supported by Germany, Belgium and the UK, recommended that the IPCC be resourced primarily by governments to ensure its integrity and neutrality

<p>Saudi Arabia, with the Republic of Korea, Bahamas and Zambia, countered that the IPCC’s integrity and neutrality need not be negatively affected by accepting contributions from external donors, saying “the door should be wide open to all who want to do good

 Saudi Arabia, with South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, and Zambia, warned that earmarking funds could potentially harm the IPCC’s integrity

 South Africa, supported by Poland, Trinidad and Tobago, and Zambia, urged against linking countries’ contributions to their participation in the IPCC

 Supporting Saudi Arabia, Senegal recommended focusing on ensuring contributions from current donor countries

<p>Japan, supported by the UK and Poland, asked what budget cuts could be made if the strategy is not successful

 Indonesia and Belgium suggested that the Secretariat’s budget could be reduced by conducting Bureau meetings without interpretation

 Poland noted that 50-70% of the IPCC’s budget relates to travel

 Norway urged agreement on which types of organizations would be acceptable, and noted the complexity of the issue of earmarking, saying that overly restricting it could jeopardize some countries’ willingness to contribute to the IPCC’s work

 France and others suggested that a small group develop terms of reference (ToR) for such a group

 Belgium, supported by Ghana, requested that IPCC-46 return to this issue when the initial ATG report is presented, that the Scholarship Programme Board of Trustees be appointed at that time, and that they be mandated to work together with the ATG

 China, supported by New Zealand, France, Togo, Ireland, Norway, Colombia, Senegal and others, noted that giving both authors and governments adequate time requires striking a delicate balance, and flexibility is necessary

 Norway and Colombia proposed setting exact dates to send draft reports to governments and/or providing intermediary drafts to governments

 Norway and Germany stated that a new Strategic Planning Schedule should be completed as soon as possible

 Switzerland said the Schedule formed an acceptable basis for the Panel’s work and that only slight adjustments should be made

<p>During the ensuing discussion, Saudi Arabia, supported by Venezuela, Zambia, Ecuador, Egypt, Madagascar, Mali, Cuba, South Africa, Tanzania and many others, lamented that the SRCCL SSC Chair had been unable to attend the scoping meeting due to his inability to obtain a visa

 Venezuela, with Ecuador, said, more generally, that the presence of developing country representatives at meetings must be guaranteed, with Madagascar and Tanzania adding that host countries must facilitate visas for developing country participants

 Mali, supported by Cuba and Tanzania, added that difficulties hindering developing country participation affect the attention given to developing country concerns during meetings

 Venezuela, supported by Spain and others, favored a short “attention-grabbing” title, such as “Climate Change and Land

” Norway, Dominican Republic, Ukraine, and Nicaragua agreed that the current report title is too long

 Cuba, Madagascar, Tanzania, Saudi Arabia, Luxembourg and others supported the title as presented

 Mali proposed adding “drought” to the long title

 Chair Sokona, supported by Luxembourg, Germany, Turkey, and Hungary, noted the utility of both a full title and a shorter informal title

<p>Ecuador, supported by Belgium, Austria, Chile and Madagascar, called for a technical summary for SRCCL

<p>The Dominican Republic, supported by Switzerland, Turkey, Italy, Norway, Ukraine, Côte d’Ivoire and others, suggested that the <strong>land degradation</strong> chapter precede the <strong>desertification</strong> chapter, and that overlap between the two chapters be avoided

 Côte d’Ivoire, Nicaragua and Mali called for including reference to drought in the chapter on desertification

<p>Poland, supported by Hungary, opined that GHG fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems are insufficiently reflected in the report and, with Belgium, India, the US, Norway, Dominican Republic, Ukraine, France, and Côte d’Ivoire, requested more attention to forests

 In the chapter on interlinkages, Brazil preferred replacing a bullet point on “competition for land” with “interaction of different types of land use

” Brazil suggested that both chapters include case studies

 Belgium, Norway, the European Union (EU), and Luxembourg also called for an explicit reference to the Paris Agreement

 Luxembourg proposed including a bullet point on how SRCCL relates to carbon sinks as referenced in the Paris Agreement

 Nicaragua disagreed, stating that reference to the Paris Agreement would serve to undermine the IPCC’s neutrality and that these reports ought to focus on “strengthening the science and technical aspects that are crucial for science-based policy making

<p>The Republic of Korea, with Turkey, called for referring to the land degradation neutrality target agreed under the UNCCD in 2015

 India noted the SRCCL outline focuses on production landscapes and called for greater attention to natural ecosystems

 France underscored the link between forests and carbon capture efforts

 Cuba emphasized the need to reflect more explicitly the relationship between ecosystems and forests, and droughts and meteorological events

 Luxembourg called for mentioning ecosystem services

<p>In the chapter on <strong>land-climate interactions</strong>, Japan suggested including approaches beyond surface modeling, to consider the interaction between land and air, and highlighting synergies and tradeoffs associated with mitigation possibilities arising from negative emissions

<p>Saint Lucia, supported by Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti, Cuba, and Dominica, called for inclusion of loss and damage

 Saint Lucia, Trinidad and Tobago, US, Japan, France, and Nicaragua supported reference to food security

 Nigeria called for referencing the link between extreme weather and conflict

 Saint Lucia, supported by Nicaragua, pointed to linkages between the issues of loss and damage, freshwater availability, extreme weather events and food security

 Hungary, supported by the Dominican Republic and Trinidad and Tobago, favored including reference to the role of GHGs in land degradation

<p>Belgium, supported by India, the US, Dominican Republic, France and the EU, suggested including reference to biodiversity; noted that IPBES is dealing with similar issues and cooperation could avoid overlap; and stressed that including reference to biodiversity is necessary for SRCCL to be comprehensive

 Germany asked the Panel to trust the experts to include all relevant ecosystems of importance

<p>In the ensuing discussion, Brazil, with South Africa, objected to mentioning forests without other land covers

 Turkey, with Switzerland, Senegal, Belgium and the UK, opposed by Saudi Arabia, reiterated the call to place the chapter on land degradation before the chapter on desertification

<p>The LDCs called for roundtables on all items, including, and supported by ARGENTINA, also for BRAZIL and URUGUAY, and AOSIS, an in-session roundtable on compliance

 The AFRICAN GROUP supported such a non-paper for adaptation communications, which the US, JAPAN and NORWAY opposed

<p>On the Adaptation Fund, ARGENTINA, also for BRAZIL and URUGUAY, proposed text welcoming the substantive progress achieved in “exchanging views and information” instead of “the negotiations

 As the contact group coalesced into huge “Warsaw-like” huddles to work out how many roundtables to convene and on what issues, one seasoned delegate wondered “how will we ever be able to agree on substance when we return to Poland in 2018?” </p>

 WGII’s contribution (Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability) was approved during IPCC-38 in March 2014 in Yokohama, Japan

 The WGIII contribution to AR5 (Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change) was approved during IPCC-39 in April 2014 in Berlin, Germany

 IPCC-37, in October 2013, in Batumi, Georgia, adopted two methodology reports, the Wetlands Supplement and KP Supplement; and undertook initial discussions on mapping the IPCC’s future

<p><strong>AR6 SCOPING MEETING: </strong>This meeting took place from 1-5 May 2017 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to draft chapter outlines for the three WG contributions to the AR6 for presentation to IPCC-46, and discuss issues related to the SYR

<p>Martine Dubuc, Associate Deputy Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Canada, welcomed participants and emphasized that Canada is relying on scientists to deliver cutting-edge knowledge to support national efforts to implement the Paris Agreement and other national sustainable development plans

 Norway, Switzerland, the UK, Germany, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, Luxembourg, New Zealand and others requested that a verbal report from the side event on enhancing gender balance in the IPCC, which took place on Tuesday, 5 September, be presented under the agenda item, “Any Other Business

 New Zealand said that the issue could be added to a future session agenda if substantive discussions were required, and Finland requested a written report from the gender meeting to facilitate information sharing for those who were not present

<strong> </strong>The UK, Norway and Japan announced their intention to expand their financial contributions

 The Netherlands announced its intention to double its contribution to a total of EUR 100,000

 Norway said it expects to increase its contribution in 2018 to more than double the amount of past years

<p>Germany, supported by Norway and Luxembourg, emphasized the importance of ensuring the SR15 SPM, at a minimum, and, optimally, the full SR15 report be made available in multiple languages ahead of UNFCCC COP 24 in 2018

<p>Germany, Sweden and Switzerland remarked on the gap between funding needs and budgeted activities, recommending solutions including non-travel meeting options, leaving IPCC derivative materials out of the budget, and conducting a budget efficiency review

 Mexico suggested developing strategic partnerships with academic institutions to enhance communications and outreach activities, while Finland suggested ensuring the clearest possible language in the original AR6 products to reduce the need for those activities in the first place

<p>Regarding the options presented by the ATG-Finance, the US, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and others supported voluntary contributions, with Japan and others highlighting the value of in-kind contributions

 The Netherlands suggested a separate fund for other sources of funding

<p>The UK, Belgium and others were open to exploring contributions from UN entities and international and regional financial institutions

 Australia expressed disappointment that annual cash contributions from the WMO and UN Environment (UNEP) had not always materialized, and, with China, Morocco and others, called for engaging the IPCC’s two parent organizations in this regard

<p>Mexico, supported by Italy, Belgium and others, proposed approaching the Green Climate Fund (GCF) for funding

<p>Belgium, Kenya, South Africa, Greece, Brazil and others suggested exploring contributions from scientific, research and philanthropic institutions as needed so long as conflict of interest is avoided

 Belgium drew attention to substantial funds received by the UNFCCC from Bloomberg Philanthropies and suggested the IPCC learn more about this

 Italy noted that research communities are often stressed for funding, while Future Earth suggested exploring other options since diverting resources from scientific research would ultimately weaken the IPCC

<p>Hungary, Poland and Brazil, opposed by Germany and Mali, suggested considering crowdfunding

 Italy pointed out that properly undertaking this option requires particular skills and could be costly

 Togo suggested the possibility of having users pay for some IPCC products

 The US, supported by Switzerland, urged caution regarding the perception of IPCC products being sponsored by particular organizations

<p>Austria, Switzerland, the Bahamas, Peru, Saudi Arabia and others preferred that governments continue to be the sole financial contributors to the IPCC

 Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Switzerland and Morocco suggested a fundraising campaign to align with the IPCC’s 30th Anniversary in 2018

<p>Nicaragua, South Africa, Zambia, Argentina, Chile and Bolivia preferred adopting a hybrid-financing approach

 Bolivia said that soliciting contributions from all levels of government could be a potential interim solution

 Zambia and Argentina favored a hybrid approach in order to ensure “fallback positions” if and when budgetary constraints require the pursuit of other funding sources

 In a similar vein, the Netherlands and Germany requested a funding timeline to ensure “Plan B” options could be drawn on to ensure the continuation of indispensable activities if the IPCC is unable to extricate itself from its financial troubles

<p>The US, France, Mali, Mexico, Finland, the Maldives and others expressed openness to a hybrid financing approach, with caveats

 In addition, some participants supported creating a dedicated group to ensure coherence across all WGs, with Spain adding that such a group should focus on cross-cutting issues, language and metrics used to measure progress, and a common glossary

 Germany called for a maximum report length of 800 pages and inclusion of low-probability, high-impact events

 China urged consistency by all WGs on the use of scenarios, with Senegal requesting that the treatment of risk and scenarios be consistent across WGs

 Sudan, supported by the US, cautioned against duplication of research in the WGI report and the SRs

 Germany, with Ireland, Norway, and the US, urged coherence across all chapters and clear communication of complex scientific concepts from the report’s outset

<p><strong>Future global climate: scenario-based projections and near-term information</strong> <strong>(Chapter 4):</strong> On Thursday, Saint Lucia, supported by Ireland, Norway, the EU, Belgium, the UK, Bolivia, Zambia and others, opposed conflating separate geoengineering concepts, noting that while GHG removal is a policy response included in the Paris Agreement, solar radiation management is not

 The Russian Federation, Senegal and Saudi Arabia pointed to scientific literature on geoengineering solutions that should be included

<p><strong>Global carbon, and other biogeochemical cycles and feedbacks (Chapter 5):</strong> On Thursday, Saudi Arabia and Singapore disagreed with the reference to carbon budgets in the proposed draft

 Japan and Co-Chair Masson-Delmotte clarified that carbon budget in this context refers to a scientific global assessment resulting from new literature

 Japan, backed by the UK and others, supported consideration of abrupt changes and irreversibility post-2100, which Co-Chair Masson-Delmotte confirmed would be done

<p>On Friday, the Group discussed the revised chapter outline, with Belgium raising concern about use of the word “global” in the revised title due to the regional aspects of the carbon cycle, and, supported by Luxembourg, suggested referring to the importance of regional aspects in the recommendations for authors, which was agreed

 Following a concern expressed by Norway, an additional recommendation for authors on ensuring differentiation between natural and anthropogenic changes was agreed

 Mexico and Saudi Arabia supported its inclusion in the chapter, and the Co-Chairs suggested including it as an example at the end of the bullet point

 This was opposed by Ireland, Germany, Spain, Norway and the UK, who noted this would give the issue of blue carbon too much prominence, and instead proposed a consideration of blue carbon in the guidance for authors

 Norway suggested changing the same bullet point to reference “land and coastal management mitigation

<p><strong>Short-lived climate forcers (Chapter 6):</strong> On Thursday, Ireland and Mali welcomed the inclusion of this chapter as per their request

 China underscored the need for a clear connection in the treatment of air quality and climate change

 Belgium and Future Earth called for inclusion of sulfates when addressing SLCFs, with Belgium asking that WGII and WGIII consider SLCFs as a cross-cutting issue affecting climate change impacts and mitigation

 India questioned this standalone chapter on SLCFs, as well as the reference to air quality, which was in the original formulation of the title, noting this is outside the IPCC’s scope and gives too much prominence to the issue, and pointing to other SLCF connections, such as glaciers and monsoons

<p>On Friday, delegates discussed the revised chapter outline, India said he could not accept maintaining reference to air quality in the chapter title, and stressed the importance of differentiating between lifespans of SLCFs, noting the temperature contribution of SLCFs is highly uncertain

 India proposed adding reference to atmospheric compositions

<p><strong>Weather and climate extreme events (Chapter 11):</strong> On Thursday, El Salvador, supported by Nicaragua, called for reference to the specific circumstances of Central America as a particularly sensitive tropical area at the intersection of two ocean systems

 The Philippines called for including reference to tropical cyclones, while Mali requested reference to drought

 Norway expressed concern that the timing of the joint session might be inadequate for completion and distribution of SR15 ahead of COP 24 in November 2018

 Echoing this sentiment, Canada delivered an oral report on the session on enhancing gender balance in the IPCC that took place on Tuesday, 5 September, noting a written report will be available on the IPCC website

 Morocco and others expressed concern about the author selection process, which often leaves developing country authors out

 Norway and WGII Co-Chair Hans-Otto Pörtner suggested that the discussion regarding page length take place at a later date, noting that the WGs have not yet had the opportunity to coordinate on the matter

 Venezuela requested that this be included in the report of the plenary but not in the WG outlines

 Belgium, supported by Germany and Luxembourg, expressed concern that referring specifically to literature related to the physical science aspects could affect WGI’s ability to fully participate on cross-cutting issues

2), Japan requested addressing the social cost of carbon in the sectoral chapters, while Saudi Arabia requested deleting reference to the social cost of carbon from the WGII outline altogether

 Norway proposed considering WGII’s contribution to the<strong> </strong>global stocktake<span dir="RTL"> </span><span dir="RTL"> </span><strong><span dir="RTL"><span dir="RTL"> </span><span dir="RTL"> </span> </span></strong>more broadly, and supported greater focus on ecosystem services, nature-based solutions and ecological shifts, and their linkages to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

<p>Canada, supported by Bolivia, Ecuador, Norway, Venezuela, Indonesia and Future Earth, proposed developing guidelines for including indigenous and local knowledge in AR6 products

 Canada recommended convening an expert meeting with indigenous leaders and offered support for such a meeting

 Switzerland suggested the IPCC could leapfrog on the approach used by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) in this regard

<p>Trinidad and Tobago, Saint Lucia, Mali, Tanzania, Grenada, the Bahamas, the Maldives, Venezuela and Zimbabwe called for reference to loss and damage in the outline, noting the issue’s relevance for policymakers

<p><strong>Point of departure and key concepts</strong> <strong>(Chapter 1):</strong> On Thursday, Bolivia said this chapter should include interactions between human and natural systems

 India supported including reference to adaptation stocktaking

 Nicaragua requested adding reference to the UNFCCC in the bullet point addressing the changing policy context

 Saint Lucia, Jamaica and FWCC opposed, noting the importance of considering losses that are difficult to monetize

<p><strong>Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and their services</strong> <strong>(Chapter 2):</strong> On Thursday, Ireland requested consideration of the vulnerability of carbon stocks in soils and biomass and of major ocean cycles

 Bolivia, Venezuela and South Africa called for referring to ecosystem “benefits” rather than “services

<p><strong>Ocean and coastal ecosystems and their services</strong> <strong>(Chapter 3):</strong> On Thursday, Norway, Japan, Canada and Belgium requested adding reference to impacts from ocean acidification, and Bolivia to economic development

 Regarding the terminology of ecosystem “services” and “benefits,” Bolivia proposed, and the group agreed, to include a reference to IPBES in the guidance to authors

<p><strong>Water (Chapter 4): </strong>In Thursday’s discussions, China called for removing reference to transboundary water resources, while India suggested addressing the link between water and food, potentially in a cross-chapter box

<p>On Friday, during the discussion on the revised outline, Ukraine suggested, and the group agreed, to refer to quality and quantity of water resources when addressing long-term risks of water security

<p><strong>Food, fibre and other ecosystem products</strong> <strong>(Chapter 5):</strong> On Thursday, India, with Norway, called for reference to fishing and subsistence farming

 India, supported by Switzerland, Belgium and Zambia, urged a stronger focus on agriculture

 India requested including reference to “feed” to the title

<p> Zambia favored broadening the text beyond “the production of food” in a bullet on adaptation options, noting that many countries experience losses along the entire food chain

 Germany supported including reference to conflict and human security

<p><strong>Poverty, livelihoods and economic development (Chapter 8)</strong>: On Thursday, India noted missing links between actual and predicted vulnerability conditions and suggested addressing human security

 Belgium suggested reflecting limitations of regional assessments in the regional chapters

<p><strong>Decision-making options for managing risk through adaptation</strong> <strong>(Chapter 17):</strong> On Thursday, Saudi Arabia, opposed by France, requested removing reference to the social cost of carbon from the bullet point on costs and non-monetized loss, benefits, synergies and trade-offs

 The Maldives, supported by Mali and others, asked for explicit mention of adaptation costs, which Co-Chair Pörtner suggested adding to the author guidance

 India, supported by Venezuela, asked for a bullet on international cooperation for adaptation and adaptation planning and implementation to the chapter

 Norway opposed

<p>Regarding a bullet point on adaptation pathways, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Bolivia, opposed by Norway, asked for the addition of economic diversification, and requested removal of reference to the social cost of carbon, preferring instead to refer to the “social effects of GHG emissions,” which India supported and Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands opposed, with the latter proposing to refer to externalities as an alternative

<p>Venezuela, supported by Ecuador and Saudi Arabia, proposed removing the concept of “human security” in the bullet on adaptation pathways, noting it was not appropriate in the context of resilience

 The Netherlands requested, and the group agreed, to include the definition of human security as contained in the AR5 glossary in the guide to authors

<p><strong>Cross-chapter papers: </strong>On Thursday, France and Spain asked for a cross-chapter box on Mediterranean regions

<p>On Friday, Sweden, Canada and Norway suggesting covering polar regions in a stand-alone chapter, because the polar regions require an arrangement to ensure that the material is assessed by the right scientists

 IPCC-49 will convene in May 2019 in Kyoto, Japan, to approve the Methodology Report to refine the 2006 IPCC Guidelines

<p>Valérie Masson-Delmotte, France and WGI Co-Chair, summarized the themes of the first five IPCC assessment reports, noting that the IPCC’s purpose is to synthesize and critique the thousands of papers published annually on, and to help improve understanding of, climate science

<p>Michel Jarraud, France and former WMO Secretary-General, further elaborated on the tension between scientists and policymakers, noting that as the political debate around the human role in climate change heated up during the 1980s, it became clear that scientific evidence was needed to support intergovernmental processes

<p>Øyvind Christophersen, Norway, elaborated on the IPCC as a hybrid institution that includes scientists and policymakers, noting that this role allows it to have “more impact than just a scientific report

<p>Thelma Krug, Brazil and IPCC Vice-Chair, said that rapid ratification of the Paris Agreement was the result of the scientific community and policymakers listening closely to each other

<p>Laurent Fabius, COP 21 President, France, attributed the success of the Paris Conference to the “alignment of three planets,” namely the:</p> 

<p>Mariane Diop Kane, Senegal, remarked that the accessibility and coverage of data and the geographical and gender representation of authors have improved over the years

 With Ecuador and India, she said the selection of chapter scientists should be transparent and open and focus on funding those from developing countries

<p>WGII Vice-Chair Andreas Fischlin (Switzerland) and WGI Co-Chair Masson-Delmotte stressed that funding should only go to scientists from developing countries

 Zimbabwe said that chapter scientists should be funded from other resources, such as the budget for assessment reports, while recalling that the Scholarship Programme was specifically aimed at disseminating and building greater knowledge of climate change, which funding chapter scientists would not necessarily fulfill

<p>South Africa, supported by Chad, Tanzania, WGII Vice-Chair Fischlin, and WGI Vice-Chair Aldrian, cautioned against eliminating funding for Ph

<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Chair Lee introduced this agenda item, and orally reported on the outcome of the 55th session of the IPCC Bureau held in Geneva, Switzerland, from 29-31 January 2018

<p>During discussions, Saudi Arabia, supported by Mali, called for a process to increase the number of authors from vulnerable underrepresented regions, such as Africa, noting that the contents of previous IPCC reports reflect the regional imbalance among authors

<p>Mexico, supported by Bolivia, called for the creation of a database of applicants for each region and greater sensitivity in the selection process to prevent discouraging scientists who are not selected

 Ecuador, supported by Togo, called for greater involvement of national focal points in contacting experts and resolving potential difficulties in their participation

<p>Responding to a comment from Japan, Pörtner said the author list will only be available after the conflict of interest process has been completed, and that, while the Bureau is responsible for author selection, non-governmental actors are also able to nominate authors

<p>Poland, supported by WGIII Vice-Chair Diana Ürge-Vorsatz (Hungary), lamented the underrepresentation of Eastern European authors

 Responding to a comment from Mali, Pörtner said that at least one African author was assigned to each chapter that deals with Africa

<p>The US noted that he did not view the text as policy prescriptive and, supported by Switzerland, said the chapter lays out empirical aspects of issues broadly related to finance and investment, and aims to assess relevant literature in a manner consistent with IPCC procedure

<p>Describing the results of the Task Force’s work, ATF-TGICA Co-Chair Andreas Fischlin (Switzerland) explained, <em>inter alia</em>, that issues remain regarding a longer-term vision, including:</p> 

<p>During discussion, the Philippines urged consideration of climate data accessibility

 In response to a query from Zambia, Co-Chair Aldrian said that under IPCC principles, task groups fall under the Bureau

<p>The US, supported by Switzerland, noted that:</p> 

 Others, including Ireland, urged that work should begin immediately, considering the busy schedule ahead

 Canada recommended that the ToR clearly recognize that IPCC products serve other purposes and audiences in addition to the UNFCCC

<p>The contact group, co-chaired by Éric Brun<strong><span dir="RTL"></span></strong>(France) and María Amparo Martínez Arroyo (Mexico) met on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, with discussions revolving around the task group title, purpose, and ToR

” Luxembourg proposed adding a bullet point stating that the task group was established at IPCC-46 in Montreal

 Pakistan and Saudi Arabia proposed changing the title of the decision and the agenda item to reflect the new title of the task group

 New Zealand, Norway, and IPCC Vice-Chair Barrett, confirmed by the Secretariat, noted that decision titles should follow the names of the agenda item, which cannot be changed at this point

 To take the concerns of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan into account, an additional sentence was added, stating that, from the next session, the agenda item will be: “Organization of the future work of the IPCC in light of the global stocktake

<p>The ToR, attached as an annex to the decision, specify that the task group, co-chaired by France and Mexico, will, <em>inter alia</em>: </p>

Past agreements in Kyoto, Cancun, Durban, and Paris benefited from clear leadership from key countries, such as the US, the EU, China, and coalitions like AOSIS and the LDCs, combined with a willingness to build alliances across traditional divides

 Questioning whether such discussions would be helpful, SWITZERLAND opposed

7:</strong> Discussions were co-chaired by Delphine Eyraud (France) and Seyni Nafo (Mali)

<p><strong>Matters Related to Article 6 (Market and Non-Market Approaches): </strong>Co-Chairs Kelley Kizzier (Ireland) and Hugh Sealy (Barbados) asked parties to differentiate between those elements of the 8 May informal notes that they see as essential to a decision in Katowice and those that could be subject to further work thereafter

<p><strong>Common Timeframes for NDCs: </strong>Co-Facilitator Marianne Karlsen (Norway) suggested, and parties agreed, that the Co-Facilitators develop a paper to guide discussions

12 (Adaptation Communication):</strong> Co-Facilitator Peer Stiansen (Norway) invited views, recalling the mandate to develop an agreed basis for negotiations

<p><strong>Further Guidance in Relation to the Adaptation Communication: </strong>Co-Facilitator Julio Cordano (Chile) asked for general views on the Co-Chairs’ tool, underlining the aim to identify clear options

<p><strong>Committee to Facilitate Implementation and Promote Compliance: </strong>In informal consultations facilitated by Janine Coye-Felson (Belize) and Christina Voigt (Norway), delegates welcomed the APA Co-Chairs’ tool as a basis for further work and expressed general reflections on its content

 The Bureau, according to one delegate, “further ramped up the pressure” by asking parties to complete two iterations of many draft texts to have draft decisions as ready as possible for Poland

<p>Co-Facilitator Edmund Mortimer (Australia) clarified that paragraph numbers have been added to the informal note to facilitate discussion but it remains otherwise unaltered from SBI 48-1

<p><strong>Matters Related to Article 6 (Market and Non-Market Approaches)</strong><strong>: </strong>In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Kelley Kizzier (Ireland) invited parties’ views on a set of three re-organized informal notes containing draft decisions, with issues sorted between an annex of essential items for COP 24 and an annex on further work

 In the afternoon’s second session, Co-Facilitator Hugh Sealey (Barbados) asked parties to focus on fleshing out provisions for a supervisory body under Article 6

” Beyond substantive outcomes, civil society members reiterated their concerns about a recent anti-protest law passed in Poland, while rumors of heads of states’ attendance and a possible declaration prompted several delegates to worry about how such political arrangements would distract from COP 24’s “already very crowded agenda

5 (Developed Countries’ Biennial </strong><strong><em>Ex-Ante</em></strong><strong> Financial Communication):</strong> Co-Facilitator Seyni Nafo (Mali) presented three questions to guide work towards draft decision text:</p>

<p><strong>Common Timeframes:</strong> In informal consultations, Co-Facilitator Marianne Karlsen (Norway) read through the revised bullets, reminding parties of the intention to capture all views

7: </strong>Co-Facilitator Delphine Eyraud (France) solicited parties’ views on the revised draft negotiating text, which incorporates submissions from six groups and parties

” Co-Facilitator Andrei Marcu (Belize) promised a third iteration for Sunday morning, but cautioned that parties’ requests would complicate his mandate to streamline the text

<p>In the afternoon, Co-Facilitator Janine Coye-Felson (Belize) presented a third iteration of the Co-Chairs’ tool

<p>The Presiding Officers’ note is due by mid-October 2018, in time to inform the “pre-COP” meeting to be held from 24-27 October 2018 in Krakow, Poland

<p>Informal consultations met throughout the week, co-facilitated by Sin Liang Cheah (Singapore) and Federica Fricano (Italy)

<strong> </strong>Negotiations were co-facilitated by María del Pilar Bueno (Argentina) and Pieter Terpstra (Netherlands)

<p>In the ensuing discussion, Gabon, for the African Group, outlined their views on several agenda items, noting, <em>inter alia</em>, that parties should have a chance to provide submissions, that the sub-items under the possible additional matters should be listed in the annex to the conclusions, and that no parallel negotiations on the mitigation section of NDCs and the transparency framework should be held at APA 1-7 in Katowice

 Gabon, for the African Group, recalled that parties have the right to submit their views at any time

 Saudi Arabia, for the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China), said the group would accept the draft text as a basis for negotiations on the understanding that parties could present new ideas in Katowice

<p>South Africa, for BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China), regretted that some parties had refused to engage on finance and technology issues, and had prevented his group’s views from being reflected as options in negotiating text

<p>Brazil, for Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, noted they had “expected a lot more” from Bangkok, and warned that parties were leaving themselves a lot of work for Katowice

<p>The Philippines expressed concern over the uneven reflection of issues in the draft text, especially in relation to finance

 Given the scope and complexity of the task, and the need to resolve enduring political differences, this brief analysis will consider the progress made in Bangkok and how it may shape outcomes at the rapidly-approaching COP 24 in Katowice, Poland

 Although many parties expressed willingness to engage informally in the coming months, and intersessional work is expected on the sidelines of the Global Climate Action Summit in California, the UN General Assembly, and the G20, it is not clear how work will further narrow down options before Poland, when pressure will be on negotiators to deliver the PAWP

<p>The Like-minded Developing Countries (LMDCs)—a coalition that includes many of these emerging economies, such China, India, and Saudi Arabia—interpret this ambiguity by recalling the Convention’s bifurcated approach

<p>IPCC-49 will convene in May 2019 in Kyoto, Japan, to, <em>inter alia</em>, approve the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 Guidelines

 The meeting was preceded by a 30th anniversary celebration of the IPCC, hosted by the Government of France

 He thanked the IPCC for responding so quickly to the UNFCCC’s invitation for the SR15, which he said will feed directly into the Talanoa Dialogue and a special event at UNFCCC COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, in December 2018

<p>Saudi Arabia, supported by Tanzania, Egypt, Pakistan, India, Mali, and Bolivia, expressed concern that the final draft had not been released well in advance of the meeting, noting that his delegation had invested time and effort reviewing the FGD

<p>Supported by the US, China, and Belgium, Saudi Arabia called for a general statement in the SPM summarizing the state of knowledge on 1

<p>The European Union (EU), supported by Luxembourg, argued that including such a generic qualifier in the introduction to an IPCC report would be unusual, noting that if no literature exists on a subject, it cannot be assessed

 Regarding the headline statement, Belgium, supported by Norway, proposed including a definition of global warming, and agreed to the insertion of a footnote clarifying that global warming in the headline statement refers to a 30-year average in a period centered on 2017, assuming the recent rate of warming continues

 The UK, supported by Estonia, called for specifying the relevant range of dates, from pre-industrial times to 2017, and text was inserted to reflect this

 </strong>Delegates proposed various alternatives for the headline statement to accommodate a request from Saudi Arabia, supported by Brazil, Egypt, and India, for language indicating that the observed increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST) is the result of a long-term trend since pre-industrial times

 Switzerland and others suggested drawing on relevant wording used in AR5 and the SR15 underlying assessment

 Following suggestions from France, Ireland, Norway, and the US, the authors proposed moving text on the rate of global warming into a new sentence and specifying that the rate is a result of past as well as ongoing emissions

 On a reference to seasons in a sentence on variations in warming levels, Kenya and Nicaragua noted that many countries do not experience seasons

<p>Regarding text on greater degrees of warming in the Arctic, Ukraine suggested including reference to “many polar regions” to also cover Antarctic hotspots

<p>Switzerland, with Ecuador, noted that mountainous areas are experiencing more global warming than low-lying areas and requested the inclusion of numbers behind a statement that warming is generally higher over land than over the ocean

 Tanzania, Mali, Zambia, and Nicaragua called for a reference to drought to reflect the realities of global climate change, but an author explained that the report had not assessed changes in drought, given a dearth of literature specific to further warming of 0

 Germany supported this proposal, but Saudi Arabia preferred deleting the entire paragraph, citing its primary reliance was on one source

 Germany, Saint Lucia, Grenada, the Marshall Islands, France, Angola, and others objected to this deletion absent guarantees that the text would be included elsewhere in the SPM

<p>On the statement that past emissions alone are unlikely to cause global warming, Sweden, supported by the Republic of Korea, cautioned that the text did not adequately reflect the headline statement’s intention to convey that warming to 1

<p>Brazil, with India and Ecuador but opposed by Saudi Arabia, called for acknowledgement that past emissions are responsible for current warming but that past emissions alone are unlikely to raise GMST

<p>France, supported by Australia, Mali, China, Spain, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Finland, and Grenada, proposed characterizing this scenario as a “thought experiment

 Responding to Australia, in reference to “non-CO2 radiative forcing,” an author explained that this refers to the aggregate impact of everything other than CO2 on global energy forcing, and noted that net anthropogenic global emissions must equal zero to halt to global warming

<p>Germany, supported by Chile, Canada, and the UK, requested language that explains that keeping within the remaining carbon budget requires net negative CO2 emissions

<p>Saint Kitts and Nevis, supported by Angola, requested acknowledgement that net negative CO2 emissions may also be required to reverse ocean acidification and halt rising global sea levels

 Egypt, supported by Saint Lucia, the Maldives, and Trinidad and Tobago, called for a stronger emphasis on the impacts on natural systems

<p>Norway, supported by Australia and Chile, proposed including a definition in the SPM of “non-CO2 radiative forcing

 A confidence level was cited (medium) following inputs from the US and Switzerland

5°C warming, Belgium, Angola, and Portugal asked for clarification on references to “changes in drought,” following which the text was modified to refer to an increase in intensity or frequency of droughts in some regions

5°C</strong> <strong>scenario and a 2°C</strong> <strong>scenario in terms of droughts and precipitation deficits, as well as heavy precipitation</strong>, Tanzania, supported by Botswana, Trinidad and Tobago, South Africa, Algeria, Egypt, the Bahamas, and Zambia, said the “heavy precipitation” language in the paragraph was “unbalanced” when contrasted to the stronger “extreme” event language in subsection B1

 Zimbabwe, supported by Egypt, argued against the emphasis on the difference between 1

<p>Mali, supported by Nigeria, WG II Vice Chair Taha Zatari, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and others, objected to the absence of West Asia and some parts of Africa in the paragraph, noting an abundance of available data on drought

 Egypt, supported by Zimbabwe, said the statement’s starting point should be the impacts of 1

<p> Germany, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg supported elevating language from a subsequent paragraph on “the possibility of triggering multi-meter sea level rise” to the headline statement

 India warned against deriving headline statements from medium confidence levels, while the EU explained that the reason for the medium confidence level relates to the incomplete approaches adopted by old studies

 Egypt, supported by India but opposed by Singapore, reiterated that the focus should be on the impacts of 1

 India noted this message would be difficult to convey to policymakers

 Egypt said the statement does not reflect the possibility of multi-meter sea level rise occurring, which would put hundreds of millions of people at risk, and noted that the underlying report discusses this

 India requested reference to adaptation costs in a sentence that notes that the slower rate of sea level rise at 1

 WG II Co-Chair Pörtner noted a lack of information regarding these costs, with India requesting that this be noted in the section on gaps in the literature

<strong> </strong>Regarding the<strong> </strong>headline statement, Germany, supported by Belgium, Sweden, the EU, and Luxembourg, called for reinserting a sentence from the FGD that warned of potential irreversible impacts in an “overshoot” (i

 Haiti, supported by the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Trinidad and Tobago, opposed reference to the “benefits” of keeping to a 1

1:</strong> On Thursday, Saudi Arabia and India expressed concern with the “medium” confidence level associated with this paragraph, which highlights <strong>specific</strong> <strong>percentages of species projected to lose their geographic range</strong>

 Saudi Arabia, supported by Pakistan and India, asked that the text explain that the underlying analysis actually focuses on differences between 1°C and 2°C scenarios, and a footnote to that effect was proposed

 Belgium, supported by the UK, Germany, Spain, Austria, Canada, and Ireland, opposed a footnote, arguing that the SPM should not contain this level of detail, and warning that the request for it bordered on interfering with the scientists’ mandated role to assess evidence in accordance with IPCC policies

 France pointed out that the text, and the SPM overall, does not mention research on terrestrial sinks

 Peru, supported by Ecuador and Botswana, highlighted similar gaps in the areas of tropical forests and savannahs

 Switzerland, the EU, Saint Lucia, Fiji, and others supported these additions, and the paragraph was agreed as presented

 Belgium noted that ocean acidification is associated with CO2 emissions, rather than with global warming per se, and that this has implications for certain geo-engineering approaches that involve continued CO2 emissions

 Responding to a request from Mali, they also agreed to indicate that further adverse effects are projected at 2°C

 Following clarification on a question from Botswana that “dryland” refers to all types of drylands, and the replacement of a reference to “populations” with “local communities,” the paragraph was accepted

 India noted that positive rainfall anomalies for Southeast Asia had been projected, and questioned why this region had been included in a list of regions for which reduced rice and maize yields have been projected

 India said an absence of literature on “associated losses” should be signaled as a knowledge gap in the SPM

1:</strong> On a paragraph on <strong>the range of adaptation options available to reduce the risks to natural and managed ecosystems</strong>, language proposed by Nicaragua on avoided “forest degradation” was added to a list of adaptation options

2:</strong> Regarding a paragraph addressing a <strong>reduction in</strong> <strong>non-CO2 emissions</strong>, Australia questioned the high-energy demand assumed in some pathways

 Brazil noted that some pathways assume high bioenergy demand, and emphasized the importance of discussing appropriate management approaches if these demands are to be sustainable

 Mexico called for including a definition of non-CO2 emissions in the SPM, and a footnote to this effect was added

<p>On the remaining carbon budget, Japan and Saudi Arabia noted a lack of clarity on the text’s two budget numbers, based on different probabilities of limiting global warming to 1

 China and the US queried the scenarios used for the carbon budget and related uncertainties

 India proposed starting with the total carbon budget and then referring to the remaining carbon budget

<p>The Marshall Islands and Saint Kitts and Nevis, opposed by the Netherlands and the Republic of Korea, suggested deleting a sentence referring to the significance for the carbon budget of defining global warming in terms of either global mean air temperature or GMST, given the potential for confusion

<p>On the implications of historical emissions for the remaining carbon budget, Switzerland proposed improving the logical flow of the carbon budget paragraphs

 India and Germany suggested adding language noting that the 1

<p>Several countries, including Grenada, Togo, and China, pointed to inconsistencies between this section and the corresponding chapter in the underlying report

<p>On uncertainties and choices regarding non-CO2 mitigation vis-à-vis carbon budgets, Belgium, supported by Grenada, noted that pursuing any limit in temperature with a probability higher than 66% implies a smaller carbon budget

<p>An author agreed with France and Grenada that following different decarbonization pathways alters possibilities for non-CO2 mitigation

 Switzerland, supported by Trinidad and Tobago, requested that the authors reconsider trying to agree on one number for a carbon budget

 India objected, while the Netherlands highlighted the uncertainties in the carbon budget exercise

<p>A contact group, co-chaired by France and the Marshall Islands, addressed the carbon budget on Thursday evening and Friday morning

 A lengthy discussion ensued as Egypt requested further reference to those numbers in the AR5 carbon budget to allow for consistency, and to avoid the impression that the latest estimations invalidate the carbon budget presented in AR5

 With the addition of reference to the transport sector, as proposed by Luxembourg and France, the paragraph was agreed with minor editorial changes

5°C with no or limited overshoot</strong>, Germany, France, Canada, Grenada, Switzerland, the EU, and Belgium called for reinserting text from the FGD on the significantly decreased share of primary energy from coal under pathways consistent with 1

 Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Pakistan, Estonia, and the US opposed singling out a specific fossil fuel

 India noted the difference between energy demand and energy need

 The EU also drew attention to “radical improvements” on energy efficiency, and Belgium suggested text to indicate that a system transition in electricity generation may be underway

 Germany asked for the full list of low-carbon energy sources, including renewables, nuclear, and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS), to be removed, which Saudi Arabia, the US, and Japan opposed

 France, supported by Belgium, asked for reinserting a description of coal use in 1

3: </strong>Regarding a paragraph on<strong> emissions from industry</strong>, Japan suggested replacing “technically proven” with “technically possible” when referring to new and existing technologies and practices, including electrification, hydrogen, sustainable bio-based feedstocks, product substitution, and carbon capture, utilization and storage

 Egypt proposed reflecting the institutional and economic constraints to deploying these new technologies and practices

<p>On Saturday, following contact group discussions, India and Norway proposed specifying that new and existing technologies and practices are technically proven “at various scales<em>

<p>The EU, with Germany and Switzerland, suggested also referring to resource use efficiency or “material substitution,” for example in the construction sector, and called for inserting language on the percentage of electricity demand in the building sector

<p>Egypt, with Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Ecuador, objected to referring to social, institutional, and economic barriers as those that “may” inhibit avenues towards an urban and infrastructure system transition, saying it was not reflective of the great challenges facing developing countries

 Brazil pointed to financial and technology transfer barriers

 Following a request by Belgium and Norway, a sentence was added reflecting that “technical measures and practices enabling deep emissions reductions include various energy efficiency options,” to replace a deleted sentence that had included reference to electrification

5</strong>°<strong>C with no or limited overshoot</strong>, the EU said the numbers presented for the amount of land needed for energy projects and forests come from model projections and, supported by Brazil, noted that the numbers assume a steep increase in agricultural productivity, the feasibility of which might not have been considered

 Germany called for language on conservation measures

<p>The Netherlands said he did not understand the background and justification for many of the paragraph’s statements, noting that 500 million hectares of agricultural land equals a third of all agricultural lands

 India noted a 3% decline in forest cover between 1990 and 2015, according to the latest Forest Resource Assessment of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO)

 Saudi Arabia, supported by Egypt, had commented that data on costs is crucial for policymakers, and pointed to many useful details in the underlying report, such as that 2016-2050 energy costs to support a 1

 In plenary on Friday, India asked that the figures be given context by comparison to, for example, global GDP or energy investment

 Switzerland asked for clarity on the role of CDR in addressing “residual” emissions and, in response, the text was rewritten to clarify CDR’s two roles: compensating for positive emissions on the pathway to 1

 India asked for language indicating that models were hypotheticals, and the text was revised to that effect and agreed

5</strong> °<strong>C pathways</strong>, Switzerland, supported by India, asked for language clarifying that outcomes were “projected” to convey the involvement of scenarios, and this change was made

 China questioned the high confidence level associated with the assertion that some 1

 In response to a question from Tanzania, an author explained that the paragraph’s final sentence seeks to convey that extracting a ton of carbon from the atmosphere might not be as effective as not emitting it in the first place, and suggested a reference to “net negative emissions,” instead of CDR to enhance clarity

 In response to a request from Switzerland, an author said referring to “mostly negative” impacts of CDR measures would not be appropriate, given that CDR measures also include afforestation and ecosystem restoration

 Switzerland proposed, and delegates agreed to, inclusion of a reference to impacts on ecosystem “functions and” services

 In response to interventions from Brazil and Norway, participants agreed on language stating that afforestation and bioenergy “may,” rather than “can,” compete with other land uses

5</strong>: On <strong>AFOLU-related CDR measures</strong>, eSwatini, supported by Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Tanzania, questioned language calling for “effective governance,” and proposed replacing it with reference to “sustainable land management

” Germany, supported by the Dominican Republic, Switzerland, Norway, Ireland, Poland, and Luxembourg, argued that effective governance was broader than sustainable land management, in that it involves, <em>inter alia</em>, administering participatory approaches, conserving carbon stocks, and undertaking measurement and verification

5°C target, but Saudi Arabia, supported by Egypt, opposed the reference to NDCs, arguing that NDCs were outside the mandate and agreed outline for SR15

 This was opposed by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Ecuador, who opposed reference to the Paris Agreement, and by Saint Kitts and Nevis, the Marshall Islands, Belgium, Grenada, and France, who preferred the previous formulation with explicit reference to NDCs

 He noted the greatest weight of opinion rested with the contact group text, which referenced the Paris Agreement but not NDCs, and proposed its acceptance, with Saudi Arabia and Egypt requesting to record their opposition in the report of IPCC-48

<p>The Netherlands, supported by many countries, argued that the draft text was policy relevant but not policy prescriptive

 When brought back to plenary on Saturday, WG III Co-Chair Skea presented the contact group wording for both paragraphs, without reference to NDCs but with reference to the Paris Agreement, with Saudi Arabia and Egypt requesting to record their objections in the meeting report

1:</strong> On this paragraph on <strong>adaptation options that reduce the vulnerability of human and natural systems</strong>, Nicaragua proposed highlighting the links between agriculture and forestry in a sentence listing synergies between adaptation and sustainable development

2: </strong>On a paragraph on<strong> adaptation options resulting in trade-offs or maladaptations with adverse impacts for sustainable development</strong>, which had originally referred only to poorly designed and implemented adaptation options, Spain advocated using the term “maladaptation” for adaptation with adverse impacts for sustainable development

<p>Tanzania, Ecuador, and Brazil questioned the example of intensive agriculture in a sentence highlighting poor adaptation efforts and their effects, while El Salvador queried text describing the negative impacts of urban infrastructure

 Brazil and Chile suggested deleting both examples, as well as the list of impacts

 India noted inclusion of intensive agriculture as poor adaptation contradicts a statement elsewhere in the SPM stating its necessity for achieving the 1

 Egypt said barriers to pathways should also be reflected, and, supported by Saudi Arabia, suggested a new sentence on “acknowledging the conditions for achieving sustainable development, eradicating poverty, and reducing inequalities in a 1

” In response to India, the author clarified that the first high confidence level referred to in the paragraph reflects that studies show that limited energy demand is associated with a higher level of synergies

 Reference was also included on the challenges related to implementation, including those of energy costs, international competition, and depreciation of assets, as suggested by Egypt, and to the potential for maximizing co-benefits, as proposed by Germany

 Reference was also included to various implementation-related challenges including energy costs, international competition, and depreciation of assets, as suggested by Egypt, and to the potential for maximizing co-benefits, as proposed by Germany

 In response to a concern from India, a reference to “public” support for such technologies was introduced

 India also said that developing countries’ position in the UNFCCC process is that public support is needed in addition to markets and said the literature on contested issues must reflect both sides of the debate

 Brazil called for replacing “market uptake” with “private sector engagement and adoption

 In response to a query from India, an author responded that the term “non-state actors” refers to civil society or societies, and the private sector, and noted that examples of civil society are listed in the underlying chapter

 In response to interventions from Zimbabwe, Switzerland, and Singapore, a reference to differing potential for climate-resilient development pathways being due to different “starting points” was changed to refer to different “systemic vulnerabilities

5</strong> °<strong>C pathways and cooperation and sustainable development</strong>, India asked what was meant by cooperation

 She agreed with Egypt that gender-“responsive” policies could also be referred to as gender-“sensitive

” Egypt, supported by Saudi Arabia, stressed the need to refer not just to innovative finance, but to finance in general

 China suggested language reflecting that international cooperation “is critical” for enabling conditions for implementation and, supported by India, stressed its importance for domestic implementation

 Tanzania requested clarity on the term “international cooperation

” Zambia said the UNFCCC process refers to “providing,” not “enabling” finance and technology

 In response to a query from India, the author said the paragraph’s reference to international cooperation’s role in enabling “access to” rather than “provision of” finance is a more accurate reflection of the literature

 China called for clarity on what is meant by “collective efforts

<p><strong>CDR: </strong>On Tuesday, delegates discussed, <em>inter alia</em>, Saudi Arabia’s suggestion to include a reference to CO2 “utilization” in this definition, with Switzerland highlighting interesting developments in this field, and the EU and the Netherlands cautioning that there is no guarantee that such utilization will lead to long-term removal

<p>Regarding a sentence describing sinks covered by CDR, Pakistan, supported by Ukraine, proposed deleting text stating that “natural CO2 sinks” are excluded from CDR, arguing that it may be confusing to specifically exclude such sinks when anthropogenic enhancement of them is covered

 Brazil, supported by Belgium, Germany, and the Marshall Islands, proposed retaining the text, noting that it specifies the scope of coverage

 India suggested that the definition refer to “proposed and ongoing” anthropogenic enhancement of sinks, but several countries objected

” India requested that the definition clarify that emission pathways are: model dependent; not trajectories of emissions growth or decline in specific countries; and globally aggregated and hypothetical

<p>Germany, supported by Japan, Sweden, and Belgium, requested details regarding the terms of reference for such external experts, and the budget implications

 He noted that the IPBES had benefited from a seconded finance expert from the Government of France and encouraged countries to consider such an approach for the IPCC

<p>The Republic of Korea, supported by Belgium, welcomed the idea of an electronic forum

 Bangladesh noted its intention to begin contributing in the future, while Mali, recalling its past contributions, emphasized the importance of in-kind contributions for awareness building

1), noting that the conference, held from 5-7 March 2018 in Edmonton, Canada, had recommended, <em>inter alia</em>, that the Panel consider:</p> 

5), noting the expert meeting convened from 16-18 May 2018 in Trieste, Italy, to, among other things, foster cross-WG collaboration on such information

4) on the May 2018 expert meeting held in Geneva, Switzerland

<p>Tanabe thanked Switzerland and Norway for their financial contributions

<p>Norway, supported by Switzerland, Mexico, and Chile, called for earlier development of a methodological report, specifically during the AR6 cycle

 With Sweden, he proposed that IPCC-48 take note of the expert meeting’s recommendations in its report and request additional proposals on future work on SLCFs from the TFI for discussion at IPCC-49

 Finland cautioned against overburdening the TFI before completion of its current work in May 2019

 He noted the final government review would take place between 28 January and 4 March 2019, followed by the approval session in May 2019 in Japan

<p> On Saturday afternoon, IPCC Secretary Mokssit announced that IPCC-49 would be held in Kyoto, Japan, in May 2019

 Eventually, the Co-Chairs, in a move that had exhausted delegates reaching for never-opened rulebooks in the dying hours of the meeting, invoked the rules of procedure to address lack of consensus, and Saudi Arabia and Egypt registered reservations in the final meeting report

 Various European countries, including Germany, wanted a description of the precipitous decline of coal in that mix

 All eyes now turn to Katowice, Poland, where UNFCCC parties will gather in December to take stock of efforts to date, and work to finalize the work programme that will allow the Paris Agreement to take effect in 2020

 He also explained that, since the issuance of this document, Honduras, for the Independent Association of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC), Iran, for the Asia-Pacific States, and Saudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, had proposed new agenda items, each on the special needs and special circumstances of developing countries in their respective groups or regions

 He proposed that the COP adopt the supplementary provisional agenda without a sub-item on a proposal to remove Turkey from the list in Annex I to the Convention and the four proposed items on the special needs and circumstances

<p id="show">The COP agreed to hold in abeyance the sub-items on proposals from the Russian Federation and from Papua New Guinea and Mexico and an item on the second review of the adequacy of Convention Article 4

<p><strong>Election of officers other than the President:</strong> Parties agreed that COP Vice-President Majid Shafiepour, Iran, will continue consultations until the nominations have been finalized

<p><strong>Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage (WIM):</strong> Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, and Maldives, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), noted that the consultations will consider the Executive Committee (ExCom) report and recommendations, rather than the COP’s authority over and guidance to the WIM

 On electing the members of the WIM ExCom, Maldives, for AOSIS, and the US recalled statements made in COP plenary, with AOSIS noting that the footnote referring to the election of officers to the WIM does not fully reflect their views on the CMA’s governance of the WIM

<p>SBSTA Chair Paul Watkinson, France, opened the session

<p>The US and CANADA stated their support of Ukraine’s sovereignty

<p>Describing the Paris Agreement as an enhanced regime guided by equity and CBDR, Gabon, for the AFRICAN GROUP, outlined as core elements of the outcome, <em>inter alia</em>, finance, including the full operationalization of Paris Agreement Article 9

<p>Underscoring equity as a core principle, Iran, for the LIKE-MINDED DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (LMDCs), called for: a balanced treatment of all items leading to a singular omnibus decision and constructive engagement by developed countries on matters of finance and technology transfer

<p>Highlighting the vulnerability of her region, Colombia, for AILAC, stressed that effective implementation of the Paris Agreement requires consideration of countries’ special circumstances

<p>Noting that Botswana is experiencing unusual and extreme temperatures, President Mokgweetsi Eric Masisi, Botswana, said that his country’s climate efforts rely on the provision of financial support

<p>President Alain Berset, Switzerland, emphasized the need for major emitters to reduce emissions and for the poorest countries to receive support, and noted that history shows the fast movers are rewarded

<p>President Raimonds Vējonis, Latvia, called for a robust transparency framework to send a strong signal to the private sector, and for not reinterpreting the Paris Agreement

<p>President Rumen Radev, Bulgaria, stressed the need for predictable implementation guidelines to send a strong signal about the solidity of the Paris Agreement

<p>Grand Duke Henri, Luxembourg, congratulated the Polish COP Presidency on its declaration, noting it is “timely to insist on the social aspect” of climate change

<p>President Borut Pahor, Slovenia, highlighted recent public debates on climate change and said his country’s long-term climate strategy would be its most important document since independence

<p>President Sauli Niinistö, Finland, said his country has banned the use of coal for energy by 2029 and aims to reach carbon neutrality by 2045
